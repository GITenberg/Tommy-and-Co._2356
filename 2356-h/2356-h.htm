<h2>STORY THE FIRST&mdash;Peter Hope plans his Prospectus</h2>
<p>&ldquo;Come in!&rdquo; said Peter Hope.</p>
<p>Peter Hope was tall and thin, clean-shaven but for a pair of
side whiskers close-cropped and terminating just below the ear,
with hair of the kind referred to by sympathetic barbers as
&ldquo;getting a little thin on the top, sir,&rdquo; but arranged
with economy, that everywhere is poverty&rsquo;s true
helpmate.&nbsp; About Mr. Peter Hope&rsquo;s linen, which was
white though somewhat frayed, there was a self-assertiveness that
invariably arrested the attention of even the most casual
observer.&nbsp; Decidedly there was too much of it&mdash;its
ostentation aided and abetted by the retiring nature of the
cut-away coat, whose chief aim clearly was to slip off and
disappear behind its owner&rsquo;s back.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m a
poor old thing,&rdquo; it seemed to say.&nbsp; &ldquo;I
don&rsquo;t shine&mdash;or, rather, I shine too much among these
up-to-date young modes.&nbsp; I only hamper you.&nbsp; You would
be much more comfortable without me.&rdquo;&nbsp; To persuade it
to accompany him, its proprietor had to employ force, keeping
fastened the lowest of its three buttons.&nbsp; At every step, it
struggled for its liberty.&nbsp; Another characteristic of
Peter&rsquo;s, linking him to the past, was his black silk
cravat, secured by a couple of gold pins chained together.&nbsp;
Watching him as he now sat writing, his long legs encased in
tightly strapped grey trousering, crossed beneath the table, the
lamplight falling on his fresh-complexioned face, upon the
shapely hand that steadied the half-written sheet, a stranger
might have rubbed his eyes, wondering by what hallucination he
thus found himself in presence seemingly of some young beau
belonging to the early &rsquo;forties; but looking closer, would
have seen the many wrinkles.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come in!&rdquo; repeated Mr. Peter Hope, raising his
voice, but not his eyes.</p>
<p>The door opened, and a small, white face, out of which gleamed
a pair of bright, black eyes, was thrust sideways into the
room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come in!&rdquo; repeated Mr. Peter Hope for the third
time.&nbsp; &ldquo;Who is it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>A hand not over clean, grasping a greasy cloth cap, appeared
below the face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not ready yet,&rdquo; said Mr. Hope.&nbsp; &ldquo;Sit
down and wait.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The door opened wider, and the whole of the figure slid in
and, closing the door behind it, sat itself down upon the extreme
edge of the chair nearest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Which are you&mdash;<i>Central News</i> or
<i>Courier</i>?&rdquo; demanded Mr. Peter Hope, but without
looking up from his work.</p>
<p>The bright, black eyes, which had just commenced an
examination of the room by a careful scrutiny of the smoke-grimed
ceiling, descended and fixed themselves upon the one clearly
defined bald patch upon his head that, had he been aware of it,
would have troubled Mr. Peter Hope.&nbsp; But the full, red lips
beneath the turned-up nose remained motionless.</p>
<p>That he had received no answer to his question appeared to
have escaped the attention of Mr. Peter Hope.&nbsp; The thin,
white hand moved steadily to and fro across the paper.&nbsp;
Three more sheets were added to those upon the floor.&nbsp; Then
Mr. Peter Hope pushed back his chair and turned his gaze for the
first time upon his visitor.</p>
<p>To Peter Hope, hack journalist, long familiar with the genus
Printer&rsquo;s Devil, small white faces, tangled hair, dirty
hands, and greasy caps were common objects in the neighbourhood
of that buried rivulet, the Fleet.&nbsp; But this was a new
species.&nbsp; Peter Hope sought his spectacles, found them after
some trouble under a heap of newspapers, adjusted them upon his
high, arched nose, leant forward, and looked long and up and
down.</p>
<p>&ldquo;God bless my soul!&rdquo; said Mr. Peter Hope.&nbsp;
&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The figure rose to its full height of five foot one and came
forward slowly.</p>
<p>Over a tight-fitting garibaldi of blue silk, excessively
<i>d&eacute;collet&eacute;</i>, it wore what once had been a
boy&rsquo;s pepper-and-salt jacket.&nbsp; A worsted comforter
wound round the neck still left a wide expanse of throat showing
above the garibaldi.&nbsp; Below the jacket fell a long, black
skirt, the train of which had been looped up about the waist and
fastened with a cricket-belt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who are you?&nbsp; What do you want?&rdquo; asked Mr.
Peter Hope.</p>
<p>For answer, the figure, passing the greasy cap into its other
hand, stooped down and, seizing the front of the long skirt,
began to haul it up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t do that!&rdquo; said Mr. Peter Hope.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I say, you know, you&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>But by this time the skirt had practically disappeared,
leaving to view a pair of much-patched trousers, diving into the
right-hand pocket of which the dirty hand drew forth a folded
paper, which, having opened and smoothed out, it laid upon the
desk.</p>
<p>Mr. Peter Hope pushed up his spectacles till they rested on
his eyebrows, and read aloud&mdash;&ldquo;&lsquo;Steak and Kidney
Pie, 4d.; Do. (large size), <i>6d.</i>; Boiled
Mutton&mdash;&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s where I&rsquo;ve been for the last two
weeks,&rdquo; said the figure,&mdash;&ldquo;Hammond&rsquo;s
Eating House!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The listener noted with surprise that the voice&mdash;though
it told him as plainly as if he had risen and drawn aside the red
rep curtains, that outside in Gough Square the yellow fog lay
like the ghost of a dead sea&mdash;betrayed no Cockney accent,
found no difficulty with its aitches.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You ask for Emma.&nbsp; She&rsquo;ll say a good word
for me.&nbsp; She told me so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, my good&mdash;&rdquo; Mr. Peter Hope, checking
himself, sought again the assistance of his glasses.&nbsp; The
glasses being unable to decide the point, their owner had to put
the question bluntly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you a boy or a girl?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I dunno.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t know!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the difference?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Peter Hope stood up, and taking the strange figure by the
shoulders, turned it round slowly twice, apparently under the
impression that the process might afford to him some clue.&nbsp;
But it did not.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is your name?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tommy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tommy what?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Anything you like.&nbsp; I dunno.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve had
so many of &rsquo;em.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you want?&nbsp; What have you come
for?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re Mr. Hope, ain&rsquo;t you, second floor,
16, Gough Square?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is my name.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You want somebody to do for you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mean a housekeeper!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t say anything about housekeeper.&nbsp; Said
you wanted somebody to do for you&mdash;cook and clean the place
up.&nbsp; Heard &rsquo;em talking about it in the shop this
afternoon.&nbsp; Old lady in green bonnet was asking Mother
Hammond if she knew of anyone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mrs. Postwhistle&mdash;yes, I did ask her to look out
for someone for me.&nbsp; Why, do you know of anyone?&nbsp; Have
you been sent by anybody?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t want anything too &rsquo;laborate in
the way o&rsquo; cooking?&nbsp; You was a simple old chap, so
they said; not much trouble.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No&mdash;no.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t want
much&mdash;someone clean and respectable.&nbsp; But why
couldn&rsquo;t she come herself?&nbsp; Who is it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, what&rsquo;s wrong about me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I beg your pardon,&rdquo; said Mr. Peter Hope.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why won&rsquo;t I do?&nbsp; I can make beds and clean
rooms&mdash;all that sort o&rsquo; thing.&nbsp; As for cooking,
I&rsquo;ve got a natural aptitude for it.&nbsp; You ask Emma;
she&rsquo;ll tell you.&nbsp; You don&rsquo;t want nothing
&rsquo;laborate?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Elizabeth,&rdquo; said Mr. Peter Hope, as he crossed
and, taking up the poker, proceeded to stir the fire, &ldquo;are
we awake or asleep?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Elizabeth thus appealed to, raised herself on her hind legs
and dug her claws into her master&rsquo;s thigh.&nbsp; Mr.
Hope&rsquo;s trousers being thin, it was the most practical
answer she could have given him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Done a lot of looking after other people for their
benefit,&rdquo; continued Tommy.&nbsp; &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t see why
I shouldn&rsquo;t do it for my own.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear&mdash;I do wish I knew whether you were a boy
or a girl.&nbsp; Do you seriously suggest that I should engage
you as my housekeeper?&rdquo; asked Mr. Peter Hope, now upright
with his back to the fire.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d do for you all right,&rdquo; persisted
Tommy.&nbsp; &ldquo;You give me my grub and a shake-down and,
say, sixpence a week, and I&rsquo;ll grumble less than most of
&rsquo;em.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be ridiculous,&rdquo; said Mr. Peter
Hope.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You won&rsquo;t try me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course not; you must be mad.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right.&nbsp; No harm done.&rdquo;&nbsp; The dirty
hand reached out towards the desk, and possessing itself again of
Hammond&rsquo;s Bill of Fare, commenced the operations necessary
for bearing it away in safety.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s a shilling for you,&rdquo; said Mr. Peter
Hope.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rather not,&rdquo; said Tommy.&nbsp; &ldquo;Thanks all
the same.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nonsense!&rdquo; said Mr. Peter Hope.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rather not,&rdquo; repeated Tommy.&nbsp; &ldquo;Never
know where that sort of thing may lead you to.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; said Mr. Peter Hope, replacing the
coin in his pocket.&nbsp; &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The figure moved towards the door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait a minute.&nbsp; Wait a minute,&rdquo; said Mr.
Peter Hope irritably.</p>
<p>The figure, with its hand upon the door, stood still.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you going back to Hammond&rsquo;s?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve finished there.&nbsp; Only took me
on for a couple o&rsquo; weeks, while one of the gals was
ill.&nbsp; She came back this morning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who are your people?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tommy seemed puzzled.&nbsp; &ldquo;What d&rsquo;ye
mean?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, whom do you live with?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nobody.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got nobody to look after you&mdash;to take
care of you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take care of me!&nbsp; D&rsquo;ye think I&rsquo;m a
bloomin&rsquo; kid?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then where are you going to now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Going?&nbsp; Out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Peter Hope&rsquo;s irritation was growing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I mean, where are you going to sleep?&nbsp; Got any
money for a lodging?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I&rsquo;ve got some money,&rdquo; answered
Tommy.&nbsp; &ldquo;But I don&rsquo;t think much o&rsquo;
lodgings.&nbsp; Not a particular nice class as you meet
there.&nbsp; I shall sleep out to-night.&nbsp;
&rsquo;Tain&rsquo;t raining.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Elizabeth uttered a piercing cry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Serves you right!&rdquo; growled Peter savagely.&nbsp;
&ldquo;How can anyone help treading on you when you will get just
between one&rsquo;s legs.&nbsp; Told you of it a hundred
times.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The truth of the matter was that Peter was becoming very angry
with himself.&nbsp; For no reason whatever, as he told himself,
his memory would persist in wandering to Ilford Cemetery, in a
certain desolate corner of which lay a fragile little woman whose
lungs had been but ill adapted to breathing London fogs; with, on
the top of her, a still smaller and still more fragile mite of
humanity that, in compliment to its only relative worth a
penny-piece, had been christened Thomas&mdash;a name common
enough in all conscience, as Peter had reminded himself more than
once.&nbsp; In the name of common sense, what had dead and buried
Tommy Hope to do with this affair?&nbsp; The whole thing was the
veriest sentiment, and sentiment was Mr. Peter Hope&rsquo;s
abomination.&nbsp; Had he not penned articles innumerable
pointing out its baneful influence upon the age?&nbsp; Had he not
always condemned it, wherever he had come across it in play or
book?&nbsp; Now and then the suspicion had crossed Peter&rsquo;s
mind that, in spite of all this, he was somewhat of a
sentimentalist himself&mdash;things had suggested this to
him.&nbsp; The fear had always made him savage.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You wait here till I come back,&rdquo; he growled,
seizing the astonished Tommy by the worsted comforter and
spinning it into the centre of the room.&nbsp; &ldquo;Sit down,
and don&rsquo;t you dare to move.&rdquo;&nbsp; And Peter went out
and slammed the door behind him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bit off his chump, ain&rsquo;t he?&rdquo; remarked
Tommy to Elizabeth, as the sound of Peter&rsquo;s descending
footsteps died away.&nbsp; People had a way of addressing remarks
to Elizabeth.&nbsp; Something in her manner invited this.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, well, it&rsquo;s all in the day&rsquo;s
work,&rdquo; commented Tommy cheerfully, and sat down as bid.</p>
<p>Five minutes passed, maybe ten.&nbsp; Then Peter returned,
accompanied by a large, restful lady, to whom surprise&mdash;one
felt it instinctively&mdash;had always been, and always would
remain, an unknown quantity.</p>
<p>Tommy rose.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the&mdash;the article,&rdquo; explained
Peter.</p>
<p>Mrs. Postwhistle compressed her lips and slightly tossed her
head.&nbsp; It was the attitude of not ill-natured contempt from
which she regarded most human affairs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right,&rdquo; said Mrs. Postwhistle;
&ldquo;I remember seeing &rsquo;er there&mdash;leastways, it was
an &rsquo;er right enough then.&nbsp; What &rsquo;ave you done
with your clothes?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They weren&rsquo;t mine,&rdquo; explained Tommy.&nbsp;
&ldquo;They were things what Mrs. Hammond had lent me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is that your own?&rdquo; asked Mrs. Postwhistle,
indicating the blue silk garibaldi.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What went with it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tights.&nbsp; They were too far gone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What made you give up the tumbling business and go to
Mrs. &rsquo;Ammond&rsquo;s?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It gave me up.&nbsp; Hurt myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who were you with last?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Martini troupe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And before that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! heaps of &rsquo;em.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nobody ever told you whether you was a boy or a
girl?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nobody as I&rsquo;d care to believe.&nbsp; Some of them
called me the one, some of them the other.&nbsp; It depended upon
what was wanted.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How old are you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I dunno.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Postwhistle turned to Peter, who was jingling keys.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, there&rsquo;s the bed upstairs.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s
for you to decide.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What I don&rsquo;t want to do,&rdquo; explained Peter,
sinking his voice to a confidential whisper, &ldquo;is to make a
fool of myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s always a good rule,&rdquo; agreed Mrs.
Postwhistle, &ldquo;for those to whom it&rsquo;s
possible.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Anyhow,&rdquo; said Peter, &ldquo;one night can&rsquo;t
do any harm.&nbsp; To-morrow we can think what&rsquo;s to be
done.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To-morrow&rdquo; had always been Peter&rsquo;s lucky
day.&nbsp; At the mere mention of the magic date his spirits
invariably rose.&nbsp; He now turned upon Tommy a countenance
from which all hesitation was banished.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well, Tommy,&rdquo; said Mr. Peter Hope,
&ldquo;you can sleep here to-night.&nbsp; Go with Mrs.
Postwhistle, and she&rsquo;ll show you your room.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The black eyes shone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re going to give me a trial?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll talk about all that to-morrow.&rdquo;&nbsp;
The black eyes clouded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look here.&nbsp; I tell you straight, it ain&rsquo;t no
good.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you mean?&nbsp; What isn&rsquo;t any
good?&rdquo; demanded Peter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll want to send me to prison.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To prison!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes.&nbsp; You&rsquo;ll call it a school, I
know.&nbsp; You ain&rsquo;t the first that&rsquo;s tried that
on.&nbsp; It won&rsquo;t work.&rdquo;&nbsp; The bright, black
eyes were flashing passionately.&nbsp; &ldquo;I ain&rsquo;t done
any harm.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m willing to work.&nbsp; I can keep
myself.&nbsp; I always have.&nbsp; What&rsquo;s it got to do with
anybody else?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Had the bright, black eyes retained their expression of
passionate defiance, Peter Hope might have retained his common
sense.&nbsp; Only Fate arranged that instead they should suddenly
fill with wild tears.&nbsp; And at sight of them Peter&rsquo;s
common sense went out of the room disgusted, and there was born
the history of many things.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be silly,&rdquo; said Peter.&nbsp;
&ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t understand.&nbsp; Of course I&rsquo;m
going to give you a trial.&nbsp; You&rsquo;re going to
&lsquo;do&rsquo; for me.&nbsp; I merely meant that we&rsquo;d
leave the details till to-morrow.&nbsp; Come, housekeepers
don&rsquo;t cry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The little wet face looked up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mean it?&nbsp; Honour bright?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Honour bright.&nbsp; Now go and wash yourself.&nbsp;
Then you shall get me my supper.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The odd figure, still heaving from its paroxysm of sobs, stood
up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I have my grub, my lodging, and sixpence a
week?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, yes; I think that&rsquo;s a fair
arrangement,&rdquo; agreed Mr. Peter Hope, considering.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you, Mrs. Postwhistle?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;With a frock&mdash;or a suit of trousers&mdash;thrown
in,&rdquo; suggested Mrs. Postwhistle.&nbsp; &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
generally done.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If it&rsquo;s the custom, certainly,&rdquo; agreed Mr.
Peter Hope.&nbsp; &ldquo;Sixpence a week and clothes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And this time it was Peter that, in company with Elizabeth,
sat waiting the return of Tommy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I rather hope,&rdquo; said Peter, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s a
boy.&nbsp; It was the fogs, you know.&nbsp; If only I could have
afforded to send him away!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Elizabeth looked thoughtful.&nbsp; The door opened.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah! that&rsquo;s better, much better,&rdquo; said Mr.
Peter Hope.&nbsp; &ldquo;&rsquo;Pon my word, you look quite
respectable.&rdquo;</p>
<p>By the practical Mrs. Postwhistle a working agreement,
benefiting both parties, had been arrived at with the
long-trained skirt; while an ample shawl arranged with judgment
disguised the nakedness that lay below.&nbsp; Peter, a fastidious
gentleman, observed with satisfaction that the hands, now clean,
had been well cared for.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Give me that cap,&rdquo; said Peter.&nbsp; He threw it
in the glowing fire.&nbsp; It burned brightly, diffusing strange
odours.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a travelling cap of mine hanging up in
the passage.&nbsp; You can wear that for the present.&nbsp; Take
this half-sovereign and get me some cold meat and beer for
supper.&nbsp; You&rsquo;ll find everything else you want in that
sideboard or else in the kitchen.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t ask me a
hundred questions, and don&rsquo;t make a noise,&rdquo; and Peter
went back to his work.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good idea, that half-sovereign,&rdquo; said
Peter.&nbsp; &ldquo;Shan&rsquo;t be bothered with &lsquo;Master
Tommy&rsquo; any more, don&rsquo;t expect.&nbsp; Starting a
nursery at our time of life.&nbsp; Madness.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Peter&rsquo;s pen scratched and spluttered.&nbsp; Elizabeth kept
an eye upon the door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quarter of an hour,&rdquo; said Peter, looking at his
watch.&nbsp; &ldquo;Told you so.&rdquo;&nbsp; The article on
which Peter was now engaged appeared to be of a worrying
nature.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then why,&rdquo; said Peter, &ldquo;why did he refuse
that shilling?&nbsp; Artfulness,&rdquo; concluded Peter,
&ldquo;pure artfulness.&nbsp; Elizabeth, old girl, we&rsquo;ve
got out of this business cheaply.&nbsp; Good idea, that
half-sovereign.&rdquo;&nbsp; Peter gave vent to a chuckle that
had the effect of alarming Elizabeth.</p>
<p>But luck evidently was not with Peter that night.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pingle&rsquo;s was sold out,&rdquo; explained Tommy,
entering with parcels; &ldquo;had to go to Bow&rsquo;s in
Farringdon Street.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; said Peter, without looking up.</p>
<p>Tommy passed through into the little kitchen behind.&nbsp;
Peter wrote on rapidly, making up for lost time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good!&rdquo; murmured Peter, smiling to himself,
&ldquo;that&rsquo;s a neat phrase.&nbsp; That ought to irritate
them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now, as he wrote, while with noiseless footsteps Tommy, unseen
behind him, moved to and fro and in and out the little kitchen,
there came to Peter Hope this very curious experience: it felt to
him as if for a long time he had been ill&mdash;so ill as not
even to have been aware of it&mdash;and that now he was beginning
to be himself again; consciousness of things returning to
him.&nbsp; This solidly furnished, long, oak-panelled room with
its air of old-world dignity and repose&mdash;this sober, kindly
room in which for more than half his life he had lived and
worked&mdash;why had he forgotten it?&nbsp; It came forward
greeting him with an amused smile, as of some old friend long
parted from.&nbsp; The faded photos, in stiff, wooden frames upon
the chimney-piece, among them that of the fragile little woman
with the unadaptable lungs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;God bless my soul!&rdquo; said Mr. Peter Hope, pushing
back his chair.&nbsp; &ldquo;It&rsquo;s thirty years ago.&nbsp;
How time does fly!&nbsp; Why, let me see, I must
be&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;D&rsquo;you like it with a head on it?&rdquo; demanded
Tommy, who had been waiting patiently for signs.</p>
<p>Peter shook himself awake and went to his supper.</p>
<p>A bright idea occurred to Peter in the night.&nbsp; &ldquo;Of
course; why didn&rsquo;t I think of it before?&nbsp; Settle the
question at once.&rdquo;&nbsp; Peter fell into an easy sleep.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tommy,&rdquo; said Peter, as he sat himself down to
breakfast the next morning.&nbsp; &ldquo;By-the-by,&rdquo; asked
Peter with a puzzled expression, putting down his cup,
&ldquo;what is this?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cauffee,&rdquo; informed him Tommy.&nbsp; &ldquo;You
said cauffee.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; replied Peter.&nbsp; &ldquo;For the future,
Tommy, if you don&rsquo;t mind, I will take tea of a
morning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All the same to me,&rdquo; explained the agreeable
Tommy, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s your breakfast.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What I was about to say,&rdquo; continued Peter,
&ldquo;was that you&rsquo;re not looking very well,
Tommy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m all right,&rdquo; asserted Tommy;
&ldquo;never nothing the matter with me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not that you know of, perhaps; but one can be in a very
bad way, Tommy, without being aware of it.&nbsp; I cannot have
anyone about me that I am not sure is in thoroughly sound
health.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you mean you&rsquo;ve changed your mind and want to
get rid of me&mdash;&rdquo; began Tommy, with its chin in the
air.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want any of your uppishness,&rdquo;
snapped Peter, who had wound himself up for the occasion to a
degree of assertiveness that surprised even himself.&nbsp;
&ldquo;If you are a thoroughly strong and healthy person, as I
think you are, I shall be very glad to retain your
services.&nbsp; But upon that point I must be satisfied.&nbsp; It
is the custom,&rdquo; explained Peter.&nbsp; &ldquo;It is always
done in good families.&nbsp; Run round to this
address&rdquo;&mdash;Peter wrote it upon a leaf of his
notebook&mdash;&ldquo;and ask Dr. Smith to come and see me before
he begins his round.&nbsp; You go at once, and don&rsquo;t let us
have any argument.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is the way to talk to that young
person&mdash;clearly,&rdquo; said Peter to himself, listening to
Tommy&rsquo;s footsteps dying down the stairs.</p>
<p>Hearing the street-door slam, Peter stole into the kitchen and
brewed himself a cup of coffee.</p>
<p>Dr. Smith, who had commenced life as Herr Schmidt, but who in
consequence of difference of opinion with his Government was now
an Englishman with strong Tory prejudices, had but one sorrow: it
was that strangers would mistake him for a foreigner.&nbsp; He
was short and stout, with bushy eyebrows and a grey moustache,
and looked so fierce that children cried when they saw him, until
he patted them on the head and addressed them as &ldquo;mein
leedle frent&rdquo; in a voice so soft and tender that they had
to leave off howling just to wonder where it came from.&nbsp; He
and Peter, who was a vehement Radical, had been cronies for many
years, and had each an indulgent contempt for the other&rsquo;s
understanding, tempered by a sincere affection for one another
they would have found it difficult to account for.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What tink you is de matter wid de leedle wench?&rdquo;
demanded Dr. Smith, Peter having opened the case.&nbsp; Peter
glanced round the room.&nbsp; The kitchen door was closed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do you know it&rsquo;s a wench?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The eyes beneath the bushy brows grew rounder.&nbsp; &ldquo;If
id is not a wench, why dress it&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t dressed it,&rdquo; interrupted
Peter.&nbsp; &ldquo;Just what I&rsquo;m waiting to do&mdash;so
soon as I know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And Peter recounted the events of the preceding evening.</p>
<p>Tears gathered in the doctor&rsquo;s small, round eyes.&nbsp;
His absurd sentimentalism was the quality in his friend that most
irritated Peter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Poor leedle waif!&rdquo; murmured the soft-hearted old
gentleman.&nbsp; &ldquo;Id was de good Providence dat guided
her&mdash;or him, whichever id be.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Providence be hanged!&rdquo; snarled Peter.&nbsp;
&ldquo;What was my Providence doing&mdash;landing me with a
gutter-brat to look after?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So like you Radicals,&rdquo; sneered the doctor,
&ldquo;to despise a fellow human creature just because id may not
have been born in burble and fine linen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t send for you to argue politics,&rdquo;
retorted Peter, controlling his indignation by an effort.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I want you to tell me whether it&rsquo;s a boy or a girl,
so that I may know what to do with it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What mean you to do wid id?&rdquo; inquired the
doctor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; confessed Peter.&nbsp;
&ldquo;If it&rsquo;s a boy, as I rather think it is, maybe
I&rsquo;ll be able to find it a place in one of the
offices&mdash;after I&rsquo;ve taught it a little
civilisation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And if id be a girl?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How can it be a girl when it wears trousers?&rdquo;
demanded Peter.&nbsp; &ldquo;Why anticipate
difficulties?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Peter, alone, paced to and fro the room, his hands behind his
back, his ear on the alert to catch the slightest sound from
above.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do hope it is a boy,&rdquo; said Peter, glancing
up.</p>
<p>Peter&rsquo;s eyes rested on the photo of the fragile little
woman gazing down at him from its stiff frame upon the
chimney-piece.&nbsp; Thirty years ago, in this same room, Peter
had paced to and fro, his hands behind his back, his ear alert to
catch the slightest sound from above, had said to himself the
same words.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s odd,&rdquo; mused Peter&mdash;&ldquo;very
odd indeed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The door opened.&nbsp; The stout doctor, preceded at a little
distance by his watch-chain, entered and closed the door behind
him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A very healthy child,&rdquo; said the doctor, &ldquo;as
fine a child as any one could wish to see.&nbsp; A
girl.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The two old gentlemen looked at one another.&nbsp; Elizabeth,
possibly relieved in her mind, began to purr.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What am I to do with it?&rdquo; demanded Peter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A very awkward bosition for you,&rdquo; agreed the
sympathetic doctor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was a fool!&rdquo; declared Peter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You haf no one here to look after de leedle wench when
you are away,&rdquo; pointed out the thoughtful doctor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And from what I&rsquo;ve seen of the imp,&rdquo; added
Peter, &ldquo;it will want some looking after.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I tink&mdash;I tink,&rdquo; said the helpful doctor,
&ldquo;I see a way out!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The doctor thrust his fierce face forward and tapped knowingly
with his right forefinger the right side of his round nose.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I will take charge of de leedle wench.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To me de case will not present de same
difficulties.&nbsp; I haf a housekeeper.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, Mrs. Whateley.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She is a goot woman when you know her,&rdquo; explained
the doctor.&nbsp; &ldquo;She only wants managing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pooh!&rdquo; ejaculated Peter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why do you say dat?&rdquo; inquired the doctor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You! bringing up a headstrong girl.&nbsp; The
idea!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should be kind, but firm.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t know her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How long haf you known her?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Anyhow, I&rsquo;m not a soft-hearted sentimentalist
that would just ruin the child.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Girls are not boys,&rdquo; persisted the doctor;
&ldquo;dey want different treatment.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m not a brute!&rdquo; snarled
Peter.&nbsp; &ldquo;Besides, suppose she turns out rubbish!&nbsp;
What do you know about her?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I take my chance,&rdquo; agreed the generous
doctor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It wouldn&rsquo;t be fair,&rdquo; retorted honest
Peter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tink it over,&rdquo; said the doctor.&nbsp; &ldquo;A
place is never home widout de leedle feet.&nbsp; We Englishmen
love de home.&nbsp; You are different.&nbsp; You haf no
sentiment.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I cannot help feeling,&rdquo; explained Peter, &ldquo;a
sense of duty in this matter.&nbsp; The child came to me.&nbsp;
It is as if this thing had been laid upon me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you look upon id dat way, Peter,&rdquo; sighed the
doctor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;With sentiment,&rdquo; went on Peter, &ldquo;I have
nothing to do; but duty&mdash;duty is quite another
thing.&rdquo;&nbsp; Peter, feeling himself an ancient Roman,
thanked the doctor and shook hands with him.</p>
<p>Tommy, summoned, appeared.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The doctor, Tommy,&rdquo; said Peter, without looking
up from his writing, &ldquo;gives a very satisfactory account of
you.&nbsp; So you can stop.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Told you so,&rdquo; returned Tommy.&nbsp; &ldquo;Might
have saved your money.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But we shall have to find you another name.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What for?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you are to be a housekeeper, you must be a
girl.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t like girls.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t say I think much of them myself,
Tommy.&nbsp; We must make the best of it.&nbsp; To begin with, we
must get you proper clothes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hate skirts.&nbsp; They hamper you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tommy,&rdquo; said Peter severely, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t
argue.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pointing out facts ain&rsquo;t arguing,&rdquo; argued
Tommy.&nbsp; &ldquo;They do hamper you.&nbsp; You try
&rsquo;em.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The clothes were quickly made, and after a while they came to
fit; but the name proved more difficult of adjustment.&nbsp; A
sweet-faced, laughing lady, known to fame by a title respectable
and orthodox, appears an honoured guest to-day at many a literary
gathering.&nbsp; But the old fellows, pressing round, still call
her &ldquo;Tommy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The week&rsquo;s trial came to an end.&nbsp; Peter, whose
digestion was delicate, had had a happy thought.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What I propose, Tommy&mdash;I mean Jane,&rdquo; said
Peter, &ldquo;is that we should get in a woman to do just the
mere cooking.&nbsp; That will give you more time to&mdash;to
attend to other things, Tommy&mdash;Jane, I mean.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What other things?&rdquo; chin in the air.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The&mdash;the keeping of the rooms in order,
Tommy.&nbsp; The&mdash;the dusting.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t want twenty-four hours a day to dust four
rooms.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then there are messages, Tommy.&nbsp; It would be a
great advantage to me to have someone I could send on a message
without feeling I was interfering with the housework.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are you driving at?&rdquo; demanded Tommy.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Why, I don&rsquo;t have half enough to do as it is.&nbsp;
I can do all&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Peter put his foot down.&nbsp; &ldquo;When I say a thing, I
mean a thing.&nbsp; The sooner you understand that, the
better.&nbsp; How dare you argue with me!&nbsp;
Fiddle-de-dee!&rdquo;&nbsp; For two pins Peter would have
employed an expletive even stronger, so determined was he
feeling.</p>
<p>Tommy without another word left the room.&nbsp; Peter looked
at Elizabeth and winked.</p>
<p>Poor Peter!&nbsp; His triumph was short-lived.&nbsp; Five
minutes later, Tommy returned, clad in the long, black skirt,
supported by the cricket belt, the blue garibaldi cut
<i>d&eacute;collet&eacute;</i>, the pepper-and-salt jacket, the
worsted comforter, the red lips very tightly pressed, the long
lashes over the black eyes moving very rapidly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tommy&rdquo; (severely), &ldquo;what is this
tomfoolery?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I understand.&nbsp; I ain&rsquo;t no good to you.&nbsp;
Thanks for giving me a trial.&nbsp; My fault.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tommy&rdquo; (less severely), &ldquo;don&rsquo;t be an
idiot.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ain&rsquo;t an idiot.&nbsp; &rsquo;Twas Emma.&nbsp;
Told me I was good at cooking.&nbsp; Said I&rsquo;d got an
aptitude for it.&nbsp; She meant well.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tommy&rdquo; (no trace of severity), &ldquo;sit
down.&nbsp; Emma was quite right.&nbsp; Your cooking is&mdash;is
promising.&nbsp; As Emma puts it, you have aptitude.&nbsp;
Your&mdash;perseverance, your hopefulness proves it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then why d&rsquo;ye want to get someone else in to do
it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>If Peter could have answered truthfully!&nbsp; If Peter could
have replied:</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear, I am a lonely old gentleman.&nbsp; I did not
know it until&mdash;until the other day.&nbsp; Now I cannot
forget it again.&nbsp; Wife and child died many years ago.&nbsp;
I was poor, or I might have saved them.&nbsp; That made me
hard.&nbsp; The clock of my life stood still.&nbsp; I hid away
the key.&nbsp; I did not want to think.&nbsp; You crept to me out
of the cruel fog, awakened old dreams.&nbsp; Do not go away any
more&rdquo;&mdash;perhaps Tommy, in spite of her fierce
independence, would have consented to be useful; and thus Peter
might have gained his end at less cost of indigestion.&nbsp; But
the penalty for being an anti-sentimentalist is that you must not
talk like this even to yourself.&nbsp; So Peter had to cast about
for other methods.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why shouldn&rsquo;t I keep two servants if I
like?&rdquo;&nbsp; It did seem hard on the old gentleman.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the sense of paying two to do the work of
one?&nbsp; You would only be keeping me on out of
charity.&rdquo;&nbsp; The black eyes flashed.&nbsp; &ldquo;I
ain&rsquo;t a beggar.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you really think, Tommy&mdash;I should say Jane,
you can manage the&mdash;the whole of it?&nbsp; You won&rsquo;t
mind being sent on a message, perhaps in the very middle of your
cooking.&nbsp; It was that I was thinking of, Tommy&mdash;some
cooks would.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You go easy,&rdquo; advised him Tommy, &ldquo;till I
complain of having too much to do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Peter returned to his desk.&nbsp; Elizabeth looked up.&nbsp;
It seemed to Peter that Elizabeth winked.</p>
<p>The fortnight that followed was a period of trouble to Peter,
for Tommy, her suspicions having been aroused, was sceptical of
&ldquo;business&rdquo; demanding that Peter should dine with this
man at the club, lunch with this editor at the Cheshire
Cheese.&nbsp; At once the chin would go up into the air, the
black eyes cloud threateningly.&nbsp; Peter, an unmarried man for
thirty years, lacking experience, would under cross-examination
contradict himself, become confused, break down over essential
points.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Really,&rdquo; grumbled Peter to himself one evening,
sawing at a mutton chop, &ldquo;really there&rsquo;s no other
word for it&mdash;I&rsquo;m henpecked.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Peter that day had looked forward to a little dinner at a
favourite restaurant, with his &ldquo;dear old friend
Blenkinsopp, a bit of a gourmet, Tommy&mdash;that means a man who
likes what you would call elaborate
cooking!&rdquo;&mdash;forgetful at the moment that he had used up
&ldquo;Blenkinsopp&rdquo; three days before for a farewell
supper, &ldquo;Blenkinsopp&rdquo; having to set out the next
morning for Egypt.&nbsp; Peter was not facile at invention.&nbsp;
Names in particular had always been a difficulty to him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I like a spirit of independence,&rdquo; continued Peter
to himself.&nbsp; &ldquo;Wish she hadn&rsquo;t quite so much of
it.&nbsp; Wonder where she got it from.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The situation was becoming more serious to Peter than he cared
to admit.&nbsp; For day by day, in spite of her tyrannies, Tommy
was growing more and more indispensable to Peter.&nbsp; Tommy was
the first audience that for thirty years had laughed at
Peter&rsquo;s jokes; Tommy was the first public that for thirty
years had been convinced that Peter was the most brilliant
journalist in Fleet Street; Tommy was the first anxiety that for
thirty years had rendered it needful that Peter each night should
mount stealthily the creaking stairs, steal with shaded candle to
a bedside.&nbsp; If only Tommy wouldn&rsquo;t &ldquo;do&rdquo;
for him!&nbsp; If only she could be persuaded to &ldquo;do&rdquo;
something else.</p>
<p>Another happy thought occurred to Peter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tommy&mdash;I mean Jane,&rdquo; said Peter, &ldquo;I
know what I&rsquo;ll do with you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the game now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll make a journalist of you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t talk rot.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t rot.&nbsp; Besides, I won&rsquo;t have
you answer me like that.&nbsp; As a Devil&mdash;that means,
Tommy, the unseen person in the background that helps a
journalist to do his work&mdash;you would be invaluable to
me.&nbsp; It would pay me, Tommy&mdash;pay me very
handsomely.&nbsp; I should make money out of you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This appeared to be an argument that Tommy understood.&nbsp;
Peter, with secret delight, noticed that the chin retained its
normal level.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I did help a chap to sell papers, once,&rdquo;
remembered Tommy; &ldquo;he said I was fly at it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I told you so,&rdquo; exclaimed Peter
triumphantly.&nbsp; &ldquo;The methods are different, but the
instinct required is the same.&nbsp; We will get a woman in to
relieve you of the housework.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The chin shot up into the air.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I could do it in my spare time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You see, Tommy, I should want you to go about with
me&mdash;to be always with me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Better try me first.&nbsp; Maybe you&rsquo;re making an
error.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Peter was learning the wisdom of the serpent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quite right, Tommy.&nbsp; We will first see what you
can do.&nbsp; Perhaps, after all, it may turn out that you are
better as a cook.&rdquo;&nbsp; In his heart Peter doubted
this.</p>
<p>But the seed had fallen upon good ground.&nbsp; It was Tommy
herself that manoeuvred her first essay in journalism.&nbsp; A
great man had come to London&mdash;was staying in apartments
especially prepared for him in St. James&rsquo;s Palace.&nbsp;
Said every journalist in London to himself: &ldquo;If I could
obtain an interview with this Big Man, what a big thing it would
be for me!&rdquo;&nbsp; For a week past, Peter had carried
everywhere about with him a paper headed: &ldquo;Interview of Our
Special Correspondent with Prince Blank,&rdquo; questions down
left-hand column, very narrow; space for answers right-hand side,
very wide.&nbsp; But the Big Man was experienced.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wonder,&rdquo; said Peter, spreading the neatly
folded paper on the desk before him, &ldquo;I wonder if there can
be any way of getting at him&mdash;any dodge or trick, any piece
of low cunning, any plausible lie that I haven&rsquo;t thought
of.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Old Man Martin&mdash;called himself Martini&mdash;was
just such another,&rdquo; commented Tommy.&nbsp; &ldquo;Come pay
time, Saturday afternoon, you just couldn&rsquo;t get at
him&mdash;simply wasn&rsquo;t any way.&nbsp; I was a bit too good
for him once, though,&rdquo; remembered Tommy, with a touch of
pride in her voice; &ldquo;got half a quid out of him that
time.&nbsp; It did surprise him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; communed Peter to himself aloud, &ldquo;I
don&rsquo;t honestly think there can be any method, creditable or
discreditable, that I haven&rsquo;t tried.&rdquo;&nbsp; Peter
flung the one-sided interview into the wastepaper-basket, and
slipping his notebook into his pocket, departed to drink tea with
a lady novelist, whose great desire, as stated in a postscript to
her invitation, was to avoid publicity, if possible.</p>
<p>Tommy, as soon as Peter&rsquo;s back was turned, fished it out
again.</p>
<p>An hour later in the fog around St. James&rsquo;s Palace stood
an Imp, clad in patched trousers and a pepper-and-salt jacket
turned up about the neck, gazing with admiring eyes upon the
sentry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, then, young seventeen-and-sixpence the
soot,&rdquo; said the sentry, &ldquo;what do you want?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Makes you a bit anxious, don&rsquo;t it,&rdquo;
suggested the Imp, &ldquo;having a big pot like him to look
after?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Does get a bit on yer mind, if yer thinks about
it,&rdquo; agreed the sentry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do you find him to talk to, like?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said the sentry, bringing his right leg
into action for the purpose of relieving his left,
&ldquo;ain&rsquo;t &rsquo;ad much to do with &rsquo;im myself,
not person&rsquo;ly, as yet.&nbsp; Oh, &rsquo;e ain&rsquo;t a bad
sort when yer know &rsquo;im.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s his shake-down, ain&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;
asked the Imp, &ldquo;where the lights are.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s it,&rdquo; admitted sentry.&nbsp;
&ldquo;You ain&rsquo;t an Anarchist?&nbsp; Tell me if you
are.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll let you know if I feel it coming on,&rdquo;
the Imp assured him.</p>
<p>Had the sentry been a man of swift and penetrating
observation&mdash;which he wasn&rsquo;t&mdash;he might have asked
the question in more serious a tone.&nbsp; For he would have
remarked that the Imp&rsquo;s black eyes were resting lovingly
upon a rain-water-pipe, giving to a skilful climber easy access
to the terrace underneath the Prince&rsquo;s windows.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I would like to see him,&rdquo; said the Imp.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Friend o&rsquo; yours?&rdquo; asked the sentry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, not exactly,&rdquo; admitted the Imp.&nbsp;
&ldquo;But there, you know, everybody&rsquo;s talking about him
down our street.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, yer&rsquo;ll &rsquo;ave to be quick about
it,&rdquo; said the sentry.&nbsp; &ldquo;&rsquo;E&rsquo;s off
to-night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tommy&rsquo;s face fell.&nbsp; &ldquo;I thought it
wasn&rsquo;t till Friday morning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; said the sentry, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s what
the papers say, is it?&rdquo;&nbsp; The sentry&rsquo;s voice took
unconsciously the accent of those from whom no secret is
hid.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell yer what yer can do,&rdquo;
continued the sentry, enjoying an unaccustomed sense of
importance.&nbsp; The sentry glanced left, then right.&nbsp;
&ldquo;&rsquo;E&rsquo;s a slipping off all by &rsquo;imself down
to Osborne by the 6.40 from Waterloo.&nbsp; Nobody knows
it&mdash;&rsquo;cept, o&rsquo; course, just a few of us.&nbsp;
That&rsquo;s &rsquo;is way all over.&nbsp; &rsquo;E just
&rsquo;ates&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>A footstep sounded down the corridor.&nbsp; The sentry became
statuesque.</p>
<p>At Waterloo, Tommy inspected the 6.40 train.&nbsp; Only one
compartment indicated possibilities, an extra large one at the
end of the coach next the guard&rsquo;s van.&nbsp; It was
labelled &ldquo;Reserved,&rdquo; and in the place of the usual
fittings was furnished with a table and four easy-chairs.&nbsp;
Having noticed its position, Tommy took a walk up the platform
and disappeared into the fog.</p>
<p>Twenty minutes later, Prince Blank stepped hurriedly across
the platform, unnoticed save by half a dozen obsequious
officials, and entered the compartment reserved for him.&nbsp;
The obsequious officials bowed.&nbsp; Prince Blank, in military
fashion, raised his hand.&nbsp; The 6.40 steamed out slowly.</p>
<p>Prince Blank, who was a stout gentleman, though he tried to
disguise the fact, seldom found himself alone.&nbsp; When he did,
he generally indulged himself in a little healthy
relaxation.&nbsp; With two hours&rsquo; run to Southampton before
him, free from all possibility of intrusion, Prince Blank let
loose the buttons of his powerfully built waistcoat, rested his
bald head on the top of his chair, stretched his great legs
across another, and closed his terrible, small eyes.</p>
<p>For an instant it seemed to Prince Blank that a draught had
entered into the carriage.&nbsp; As, however, the sensation
immediately passed away, he did not trouble to wake up.&nbsp;
Then the Prince dreamed that somebody was in the carriage with
him&mdash;was sitting opposite to him.&nbsp; This being an
annoying sort of dream, the Prince opened his eyes for the
purpose of dispelling it.&nbsp; There was somebody sitting
opposite to him&mdash;a very grimy little person, wiping blood
off its face and hands with a dingy handkerchief.&nbsp; Had the
Prince been a man capable of surprise, he would have been
surprised.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all right,&rdquo; assured him Tommy.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I ain&rsquo;t here to do any harm.&nbsp; I ain&rsquo;t an
Anarchist.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Prince, by a muscular effort, retired some four or five
inches and commenced to rebutton his waistcoat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How did you get here?&rdquo; asked the Prince.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Twas a bigger job than I&rsquo;d reckoned
on,&rdquo; admitted Tommy, seeking a dry inch in the smeared
handkerchief, and finding none.&nbsp; &ldquo;But that don&rsquo;t
matter,&rdquo; added Tommy cheerfully, &ldquo;now I&rsquo;m
here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you do not wish me to hand you over to the police at
Southampton, you had better answer my questions,&rdquo; remarked
the Prince drily.</p>
<p>Tommy was not afraid of princes, but in the lexicon of her
harassed youth &ldquo;Police&rdquo; had always been a word of
dread.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wanted to get at you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I gather that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There didn&rsquo;t seem any other way.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s
jolly difficult to get at you.&nbsp; You&rsquo;re so jolly
artful.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell me how you managed it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a little bridge for signals just outside
Waterloo.&nbsp; I could see that the train would have to pass
under it.&nbsp; So I climbed up and waited.&nbsp; It being a
foggy night, you see, nobody twigged me.&nbsp; I say, you are
Prince Blank, ain&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am Prince Blank.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Should have been mad if I&rsquo;d landed the wrong
man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I knew which was your carriage&mdash;leastways, I
guessed it; and as it came along, I did a drop.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Tommy spread out her arms and legs to illustrate the
action.&nbsp; &ldquo;The lamps, you know,&rdquo; explained Tommy,
still dabbing at her face&mdash;&ldquo;one of them caught
me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And from the roof?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, well, it was easy after that.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s
an iron thing at the back, and steps.&nbsp; You&rsquo;ve only got
to walk downstairs and round the corner, and there you are.&nbsp;
Bit of luck your other door not being locked.&nbsp; I
hadn&rsquo;t thought of that.&nbsp; Haven&rsquo;t got such a
thing as a handkerchief about you, have you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Prince drew one from his sleeve and passed it to
her.&nbsp; &ldquo;You mean to tell me, boy&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ain&rsquo;t a boy,&rdquo; explained Tommy.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m a girl!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She said it sadly.&nbsp; Deeming her new friends such as could
be trusted, Tommy had accepted their statement that she really
was a girl.&nbsp; But for many a long year to come the thought of
her lost manhood tinged her voice with bitterness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A girl!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tommy nodded her head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Umph!&rdquo; said the Prince; &ldquo;I have heard a
good deal about the English girl.&nbsp; I was beginning to think
it exaggerated.&nbsp; Stand up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tommy obeyed.&nbsp; It was not altogether her way; but with
those eyes beneath their shaggy brows bent upon her, it seemed
the simplest thing to do.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So.&nbsp; And now that you are here, what do you
want?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To interview you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tommy drew forth her list of questions.</p>
<p>The shaggy brows contracted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who put you up to this absurdity?&nbsp; Who was
it?&nbsp; Tell me at once.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nobody.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t lie to me.&nbsp; His name?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The terrible, small eyes flashed fire.&nbsp; But Tommy also
had a pair of eyes.&nbsp; Before their blaze of indignation the
great man positively quailed.&nbsp; This type of opponent was new
to him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not lying.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I beg your pardon,&rdquo; said the Prince.</p>
<p>And at this point it occurred to the Prince, who being really
a great man, had naturally a sense of humour, that a conference
conducted on these lines between the leading statesman of an
Empire and an impertinent hussy of, say, twelve years old at the
outside, might end by becoming ridiculous.&nbsp; So the Prince
took up his chair and put it down again beside Tommy&rsquo;s, and
employing skilfully his undoubted diplomatic gifts, drew from her
bit by bit the whole story.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m inclined, Miss Jane,&rdquo; said the Great
Man, the story ended, &ldquo;to agree with our friend Mr.
Hope.&nbsp; I should say your <i>m&eacute;tier</i> was
journalism.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you&rsquo;ll let me interview you?&rdquo; asked
Tommy, showing her white teeth.</p>
<p>The Great Man, laying a hand heavier than he guessed on
Tommy&rsquo;s shoulder, rose.&nbsp; &ldquo;I think you are
entitled to it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s your views?&rdquo; demanded Tommy,
reading, &ldquo;of the future political and social
relationships&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps,&rdquo; suggested the Great Man, &ldquo;it will
be simpler if I write it myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; concurred Tommy; &ldquo;my spelling is a
bit rocky.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Great Man drew a chair to the table.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You won&rsquo;t miss out anything&mdash;will
you?&rdquo; insisted Tommy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall endeavour, Miss Jane, to give you no cause for
complaint,&rdquo; gravely he assured her, and sat down to
write.</p>
<p>Not till the train began to slacken speed had the Prince
finished.&nbsp; Then, blotting and refolding the paper, he stood
up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have added some instructions on the back of the last
page,&rdquo; explained the Prince, &ldquo;to which you will draw
Mr. Hope&rsquo;s particular attention.&nbsp; I would wish you to
promise me, Miss Jane, never again to have recourse to dangerous
acrobatic tricks, not even in the sacred cause of
journalism.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course, if you hadn&rsquo;t been so jolly difficult
to get at&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My fault, I know,&rdquo; agreed the Prince.&nbsp;
&ldquo;There is not the least doubt as to which sex you belong
to.&nbsp; Nevertheless, I want you to promise me.&nbsp;
Come,&rdquo; urged the Prince, &ldquo;I have done a good deal for
you&mdash;more than you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; consented Tommy a little
sulkily.&nbsp; Tommy hated making promises, because she always
kept them.&nbsp; &ldquo;I promise.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is your Interview.&rdquo;&nbsp; The first
Southampton platform lamp shone in upon the Prince and Tommy as
they stood facing one another.&nbsp; The Prince, who had acquired
the reputation, not altogether unjustly, of an ill-tempered and
savage old gentleman, did a strange thing: taking the little,
blood-smeared face between his paws, he kissed it.&nbsp; Tommy
always remembered the smoky flavour of the bristly grey
moustache.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One thing more,&rdquo; said the Prince
sternly&mdash;&ldquo;not a word of all this.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t
open your mouth to speak of it till you are back in Gough
Square.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you take me for a mug?&rdquo; answered Tommy.</p>
<p>They behaved very oddly to Tommy after the Prince had
disappeared.&nbsp; Everybody took a deal of trouble for her, but
none of them seemed to know why they were doing it.&nbsp; They
looked at her and went away, and came again and looked at
her.&nbsp; And the more they thought about it, the more puzzled
they became.&nbsp; Some of them asked her questions, but what
Tommy really didn&rsquo;t know, added to what she didn&rsquo;t
mean to tell, was so prodigious that Curiosity itself paled at
contemplation of it.</p>
<p>They washed and brushed her up and gave her an excellent
supper; and putting her into a first-class compartment labelled
&ldquo;Reserved,&rdquo; sent her back to Waterloo, and thence in
a cab to Gough Square, where she arrived about midnight,
suffering from a sense of self-importance, traces of which to
this day are still discernible.</p>
<p>Such and thus was the beginning of all things.&nbsp; Tommy,
having talked for half an hour at the rate of two hundred words a
minute, had suddenly dropped her head upon the table, had been
aroused with difficulty and persuaded to go to bed.&nbsp; Peter,
in the deep easy-chair before the fire, sat long into the
night.&nbsp; Elizabeth, liking quiet company, purred
softly.&nbsp; Out of the shadows crept to Peter Hope an old
forgotten dream&mdash;the dream of a wonderful new Journal, price
one penny weekly, of which the Editor should come to be one
Thomas Hope, son of Peter Hope, its honoured Founder and
Originator: a powerful Journal that should supply a long-felt
want, popular, but at the same time elevating&mdash;a pleasure to
the public, a profit to its owners.&nbsp; &ldquo;Do you not
remember me?&rdquo; whispered the Dream.&nbsp; &ldquo;We had long
talks together.&nbsp; The morning and the noonday pass.&nbsp; The
evening still is ours.&nbsp; The twilight also brings its
promise.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Elizabeth stopped purring and looked up surprised.&nbsp; Peter
was laughing to himself.</p>
<h2>STORY THE SECOND&mdash;William Clodd appoints himself
Managing Director</h2>
<p>Mrs. Postwhistle sat on a Windsor-chair in the centre of Rolls
Court.&nbsp; Mrs. Postwhistle, who, in the days of her Hebehood,
had been likened by admiring frequenters of the old Mitre in
Chancery Lane to the ladies, somewhat emaciated, that an English
artist, since become famous, was then commencing to popularise,
had developed with the passing years, yet still retained a face
of placid youthfulness.&nbsp; The two facts, taken in
conjunction, had resulted in an asset to her income not to be
despised.&nbsp; The wanderer through Rolls Court this
summer&rsquo;s afternoon, presuming him to be familiar with
current journalism, would have retired haunted by the sense that
the restful-looking lady on the Windsor-chair was someone that he
ought to know.&nbsp; Glancing through almost any illustrated
paper of the period, the problem would have been solved for
him.&nbsp; A photograph of Mrs. Postwhistle, taken quite
recently, he would have encountered with this legend:
&ldquo;<i>Before</i> use of Professor Hardtop&rsquo;s certain
cure for corpulency.&rdquo;&nbsp; Beside it a photograph of Mrs.
Postwhistle, then Arabella Higgins, taken twenty years ago, the
legend slightly varied: &ldquo;<i>After</i> use,&rdquo;
etc.&nbsp; The face was the same, the figure&mdash;there was no
denying it&mdash;had undergone decided alteration.</p>
<p>Mrs. Postwhistle had reached with her chair the centre of
Rolls Court in course of following the sun.&nbsp; The little
shop, over the lintel of which ran: &ldquo;Timothy Postwhistle,
Grocer and Provision Merchant,&rdquo; she had left behind her in
the shadow.&nbsp; Old inhabitants of St. Dunstan-in-the-West
retained recollection of a gentlemanly figure, always in a very
gorgeous waistcoat, with Dundreary whiskers, to be seen
occasionally there behind the counter.&nbsp; All customers it
would refer, with the air of a Lord High Chamberlain introducing
<i>d&eacute;butantes</i>, to Mrs. Postwhistle, evidently
regarding itself purely as ornamental.&nbsp; For the last ten
years, however, no one had noticed it there, and Mrs. Postwhistle
had a facility amounting almost to genius for ignoring or
misunderstanding questions it was not to her taste to
answer.&nbsp; Most things were suspected, nothing known.&nbsp;
St. Dunstan-in-the-West had turned to other problems.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I wasn&rsquo;t wanting to see &rsquo;im,&rdquo;
remarked to herself Mrs. Postwhistle, who was knitting with one
eye upon the shop, &ldquo;&rsquo;e&rsquo;d a been &rsquo;ere
&rsquo;fore I&rsquo;d &rsquo;ad time to clear the dinner things
away; certain to &rsquo;ave been.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s a strange
world.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Postwhistle was desirous for the arrival of a gentleman
not usually awaited with impatience by the ladies of Rolls
Court&mdash;to wit, one William Clodd, rent-collector, whose day
for St. Dunstan-in-the-West was Tuesday.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At last,&rdquo; said Mrs. Postwhistle, though without
hope that Mr. Clodd, who had just appeared at the other end of
the court, could possibly hear her.&nbsp; &ldquo;Was beginning to
be afraid as you&rsquo;d tumbled over yerself in your &rsquo;urry
and &rsquo;urt yerself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Clodd, perceiving Mrs. Postwhistle, decided to abandon
method and take No. 7 first.</p>
<p>Mr. Clodd was a short, thick-set, bullet-headed young man,
with ways that were bustling, and eyes that, though kind,
suggested trickiness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; said Mr. Clodd admiringly, as he pocketed
the six half-crowns that the lady handed up to him.&nbsp;
&ldquo;If only they were all like you, Mrs.
Postwhistle!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wouldn&rsquo;t be no need of chaps like you to worry
&rsquo;em,&rdquo; pointed out Mrs. Postwhistle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s an irony of fate, my being a rent-collector,
when you come to think of it,&rdquo; remarked Mr. Clodd, writing
out the receipt.&nbsp; &ldquo;If I had my way, I&rsquo;d put an
end to landlordism, root and branch.&nbsp; Curse of the
country.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just the very thing I wanted to talk to you
about,&rdquo; returned the lady&mdash;&ldquo;that lodger o&rsquo;
mine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah! don&rsquo;t pay, don&rsquo;t he?&nbsp; You just
hand him over to me.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll soon have it out of
him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not that,&rdquo; explained Mrs.
Postwhistle.&nbsp; &ldquo;If a Saturday morning &rsquo;appened to
come round as &rsquo;e didn&rsquo;t pay up without me asking, I
should know I&rsquo;d made a mistake&mdash;that it must be
Friday.&nbsp; If I don&rsquo;t &rsquo;appen to be in at
&rsquo;alf-past ten, &rsquo;e puts it in an envelope and leaves
it on the table.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wonder if his mother has got any more like him?&rdquo;
mused Mr. Clodd.&nbsp; &ldquo;Could do with a few about this
neighbourhood.&nbsp; What is it you want to say about him,
then?&nbsp; Merely to brag about him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wanted to ask you,&rdquo; continued Mrs. Postwhistle,
&ldquo;&rsquo;ow I could get rid of &rsquo;im.&nbsp; It was
rather a curious agreement.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why do you want to get rid of him?&nbsp; Too
noisy?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Noisy!&nbsp; Why, the cat makes more noise about the
&rsquo;ouse than &rsquo;e does.&nbsp; &rsquo;E&rsquo;d make
&rsquo;is fortune as a burglar.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come home late?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never known &rsquo;im out after the shutters are
up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gives you too much trouble then?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t say that of &rsquo;im.&nbsp; Never know
whether &rsquo;e&rsquo;s in the &rsquo;ouse or isn&rsquo;t,
without going upstairs and knocking at the door.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here, you tell it your own way,&rdquo; suggested the
bewildered Clodd.&nbsp; &ldquo;If it was anyone else but you, I
should say you didn&rsquo;t know your own business.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;E gets on my nerves,&rdquo; said Mrs.
Postwhistle.&nbsp; &ldquo;You ain&rsquo;t in a &rsquo;urry for
five minutes?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Clodd was always in a hurry.&nbsp; &ldquo;But I can forget
it talking to you,&rdquo; added the gallant Mr. Clodd.</p>
<p>Mrs. Postwhistle led the way into the little parlour.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just the name of it,&rdquo; consented Mr. Clodd.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Cheerfulness combined with temperance; that&rsquo;s the
ideal.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you what &rsquo;appened only last
night,&rdquo; commenced Mrs. Postwhistle, seating herself the
opposite side of the loo-table.&nbsp; &ldquo;A letter came for
&rsquo;im by the seven o&rsquo;clock post.&nbsp; I&rsquo;d seen
&rsquo;im go out two hours before, and though I&rsquo;d been
sitting in the shop the whole blessed time, I never saw or
&rsquo;eard &rsquo;im pass through.&nbsp; E&rsquo;s like
that.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s like &rsquo;aving a ghost for a
lodger.&nbsp; I opened &rsquo;is door without knocking and went
in.&nbsp; If you&rsquo;ll believe me, &rsquo;e was clinging with
&rsquo;is arms and legs to the top of the
bedstead&mdash;it&rsquo;s one of those old-fashioned, four-post
things&mdash;&rsquo;is &rsquo;ead touching the ceiling.&nbsp;
&rsquo;E &rsquo;adn&rsquo;t got too much clothes on, and was
cracking nuts with &rsquo;is teeth and eating &rsquo;em.&nbsp;
&rsquo;E threw a &rsquo;andful of shells at me, and making the
most awful faces at me, started off gibbering softly to
himself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All play, I suppose?&nbsp; No real vice?&rdquo;
commented the interested Mr. Clodd.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It will go on for a week, that will,&rdquo; continued
Mrs. Postwhistle&mdash;&ldquo;&rsquo;e fancying &rsquo;imself a
monkey.&nbsp; Last week he was a tortoise, and was crawling about
on his stomach with a tea-tray tied on to &rsquo;is back.&nbsp;
&rsquo;E&rsquo;s as sensible as most men, if that&rsquo;s saying
much, the moment &rsquo;e&rsquo;s outside the front door; but in
the &rsquo;ouse&mdash;well, I suppose the fact is that
&rsquo;e&rsquo;s a lunatic.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t seem no hiding anything from you,&rdquo;
Mrs. Postwhistle remarked Mr. Clodd in tones of admiration.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Does he ever get violent?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t know what &rsquo;e would be like if
&rsquo;e &rsquo;appened to fancy &rsquo;imself something really
dangerous,&rdquo; answered Mrs. Postwhistle.&nbsp; &ldquo;I am a
bit nervous of this new monkey game, I don&rsquo;t mind
confessing to you&mdash;the things that they do according to the
picture-books.&nbsp; Up to now, except for imagining
&rsquo;imself a mole, and taking all his meals underneath the
carpet, it&rsquo;s been mostly birds and cats and &rsquo;armless
sort o&rsquo; things I &rsquo;aven&rsquo;t seemed to mind so
much.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How did you get hold of him?&rdquo; demanded Mr.
Clodd.&nbsp; &ldquo;Have much trouble in finding him, or did
somebody come and tell you about him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Old Gladman, of Chancery Lane, the law stationer,
brought &rsquo;im &rsquo;ere one evening about two months
ago&mdash;said &rsquo;e was a sort of distant relative of
&rsquo;is, a bit soft in the &rsquo;ead, but perfectly
&rsquo;armless&mdash;wanted to put &rsquo;im with someone who
wouldn&rsquo;t impose on &rsquo;im.&nbsp; Well, what between
&rsquo;aving been empty for over five weeks, the poor old gaby
&rsquo;imself looking as gentle as a lamb, and the figure being
reasonable, I rather jumped at the idea; and old Gladman,
explaining as &rsquo;ow &rsquo;e wanted the thing settled and
done with, got me to sign a letter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Kept a copy of it?&rdquo; asked the business-like
Clodd.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No.&nbsp; But I can remember what it was.&nbsp; Gladman
&rsquo;ad it all ready.&nbsp; So long as the money was paid
punctual and &rsquo;e didn&rsquo;t make no disturbance and
didn&rsquo;t fall sick, I was to go on boarding and lodging
&rsquo;im for seventeen-and-sixpence a week.&nbsp; It
didn&rsquo;t strike me as anything to be objected to at the time;
but &rsquo;e payin&rsquo; regular, as I&rsquo;ve explained to
you, and be&rsquo;aving, so far as disturbance is concerned, more
like a Christian martyr than a man, well, it looks to me as if
I&rsquo;d got to live and die with &rsquo;im.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Give him rope, and possibly he&rsquo;ll have a week at
being a howling hy&aelig;na, or a laughing jackass, or something
of that sort that will lead to a disturbance,&rdquo; thought Mr.
Clodd, &ldquo;in which case, of course, you would have your
remedy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; thought Mrs. Postwhistle, &ldquo;and
possibly also &rsquo;e may take it into what &rsquo;e calls is
&rsquo;ead to be a tiger or a bull, and then perhaps before
&rsquo;e&rsquo;s through with it I&rsquo;ll be beyond the reach
of remedies.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Leave it to me,&rdquo; said Mr. Clodd, rising and
searching for his hat.&nbsp; &ldquo;I know old Gladman;
I&rsquo;ll have a talk with him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You might get a look at that letter if you can,&rdquo;
suggested Mrs. Postwhistle, &ldquo;and tell me what you think
about it.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t want to spend the rest of my days
in a lunatic asylum of my own if I can &rsquo;elp it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You leave it to me,&rdquo; was Mr. Clodd&rsquo;s
parting assurance.</p>
<p>The July moon had thrown a silver veil over the grimness of
Rolls Court when, five hours later, Mr. Clodd&rsquo;s nailed
boots echoed again upon its uneven pavement; but Mr. Clodd had no
eye for moon or stars or such-like; always he had things more
important to think of.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Seen the old &rsquo;umbug?&rdquo; asked Mrs.
Postwhistle, who was partial to the air, leading the way into the
parlour.</p>
<p>&ldquo;First and foremost commenced,&rdquo; Mr. Clodd, as he
laid aside his hat, &ldquo;it is quite understood that you really
do want to get rid of him?&nbsp; What&rsquo;s that?&rdquo;
demanded Mr. Clodd, a heavy thud upon the floor above having
caused him to start out of his chair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;E came in an hour after you&rsquo;d gone,&rdquo;
explained Mrs. Postwhistle, &ldquo;bringing with him a curtain
pole as &rsquo;e&rsquo;d picked up for a shilling in Clare
Market.&nbsp; &rsquo;E&rsquo;s rested one end upon the
mantelpiece and tied the other to the back of the
easy-chair&mdash;&rsquo;is idea is to twine &rsquo;imself round
it and go to sleep upon it.&nbsp; Yes, you&rsquo;ve got it quite
right without a single blunder.&nbsp; I do want to get rid of
&rsquo;im.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then,&rdquo; said Mr. Clodd, reseating himself,
&ldquo;it can be done.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank God for that!&rdquo; was Mrs. Postwhistle&rsquo;s
pious ejaculation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is just as I thought,&rdquo; continued Mr.
Clodd.&nbsp; &ldquo;The old innocent&mdash;he&rsquo;s
Gladman&rsquo;s brother-in-law, by the way&mdash;has got a small
annuity.&nbsp; I couldn&rsquo;t get the actual figure, but I
guess it&rsquo;s about sufficient to pay for his keep and leave
old Gladman, who is running him, a very decent profit.&nbsp; They
don&rsquo;t want to send him to an asylum.&nbsp; They can&rsquo;t
say he&rsquo;s a pauper, and to put him into a private
establishment would swallow up, most likely, the whole of his
income.&nbsp; On the other hand, they don&rsquo;t want the bother
of looking after him themselves.&nbsp; I talked pretty straight
to the old man&mdash;let him see I understood the business;
and&mdash;well, to cut a long story short, I&rsquo;m willing to
take on the job, provided you really want to have done with it,
and Gladman is willing in that case to let you off your
contract.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Postwhistle went to the cupboard to get Mr. Clodd a
drink.&nbsp; Another thud upon the floor above&mdash;one
suggestive of exceptional velocity&mdash;arrived at the precise
moment when Mrs. Postwhistle, the tumbler level with her eye, was
in the act of measuring.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I call this making a disturbance,&rdquo; said Mrs.
Postwhistle, regarding the broken fragments.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s only for another night,&rdquo; comforted her
Mr. Clodd.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take him away some time
to-morrow.&nbsp; Meanwhile, if I were you, I should spread a
mattress underneath that perch of his before I went to bed.&nbsp;
I should like him handed over to me in reasonable
repair.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It will deaden the sound a bit, any&rsquo;ow,&rdquo;
agreed Mrs. Postwhistle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Success to temperance,&rdquo; drank Mr. Clodd, and rose
to go.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I take it you&rsquo;ve fixed things up all right for
yourself,&rdquo; said Mrs. Postwhistle; &ldquo;and nobody can
blame you if you &rsquo;ave.&nbsp; &rsquo;Eaven bless you, is
what I say.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We shall get on together,&rdquo; prophesied Mr.
Clodd.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m fond of animals.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Early the next morning a four-wheeled cab drew up at the
entrance to Rolls Court, and in it and upon it went away Clodd
and Clodd&rsquo;s Lunatic (as afterwards he came to be known),
together with all the belongings of Clodd&rsquo;s Lunatic, the
curtain-pole included; and there appeared again behind the
fanlight of the little grocer&rsquo;s shop the intimation:
&ldquo;Lodgings for a Single Man,&rdquo; which caught the eye a
few days later of a weird-looking, lanky, rawboned laddie, whose
language Mrs. Postwhistle found difficulty for a time in
comprehending; and that is why one sometimes meets to-day
worshippers of Kail Yard literature wandering disconsolately
about St. Dunstan-in-the-West, seeking Rolls Court, discomforted
because it is no more.&nbsp; But that is the history of the
&ldquo;Wee Laddie,&rdquo; and this of the beginnings of William
Clodd, now Sir William Clodd, Bart., M.P., proprietor of a
quarter of a hundred newspapers, magazines, and journals:
&ldquo;Truthful Billy&rdquo; we called him then.</p>
<p>No one can say of Clodd that he did not deserve whatever
profit his unlicensed lunatic asylum may have brought him.&nbsp;
A kindly man was William Clodd when indulgence in sentiment did
not interfere with business.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no harm in him,&rdquo; asserted Mr.
Clodd, talking the matter over with one Mr. Peter Hope,
journalist, of Gough Square.&nbsp; &ldquo;He&rsquo;s just a bit
dotty, same as you or I might get with nothing to do and all day
long to do it in.&nbsp; Kid&rsquo;s play, that&rsquo;s all it
is.&nbsp; The best plan, I find, is to treat it as a game and
take a hand in it.&nbsp; Last week he wanted to be a lion.&nbsp;
I could see that was going to be awkward, he roaring for raw meat
and thinking to prowl about the house at night.&nbsp; Well, I
didn&rsquo;t nag him&mdash;that&rsquo;s no good.&nbsp; I just got
a gun and shot him.&nbsp; He&rsquo;s a duck now, and I&rsquo;m
trying to keep him one: sits for an hour beside his bath on three
china eggs I&rsquo;ve bought him.&nbsp; Wish some of the sane
ones were as little trouble.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The summer came again.&nbsp; Clodd and his Lunatic, a
mild-looking little old gentleman of somewhat clerical cut, one
often met with arm-in-arm, bustling about the streets and courts
that were the scene of Clodd&rsquo;s rent-collecting
labours.&nbsp; Their evident attachment to one another was
curiously displayed; Clodd, the young and red-haired, treating
his white-haired, withered companion with fatherly indulgence;
the other glancing up from time to time into Clodd&rsquo;s face
with a winning expression of infantile affection.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are getting much better,&rdquo; explained Clodd, the
pair meeting Peter Hope one day at the corner of Newcastle
Street.&nbsp; &ldquo;The more we are out in the open air, and the
more we have to do and think about, the better for
us&mdash;eh?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The mild-looking little old gentleman hanging on Clodd&rsquo;s
arm smiled and nodded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Between ourselves,&rdquo; added Mr. Clodd, sinking his
voice, &ldquo;we are not half as foolish as folks think we
are.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Peter Hope went his way down the Strand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Clodd&rsquo;s a good sort&mdash;a good sort,&rdquo;
said Peter Hope, who, having in his time lived much alone, had
fallen into the habit of speaking his thoughts aloud; &ldquo;but
he&rsquo;s not the man to waste his time.&nbsp; I
wonder.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With the winter Clodd&rsquo;s Lunatic fell ill.</p>
<p>Clodd bustled round to Chancery Lane.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To tell you the truth,&rdquo; confessed Mr. Gladman,
&ldquo;we never thought he would live so long as he
has.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s the annuity you&rsquo;ve got to think
of,&rdquo; said Clodd, whom his admirers of to-day (and they are
many, for he must be a millionaire by this time) are fond of
alluding to as &ldquo;that frank, outspoken
Englishman.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Wouldn&rsquo;t it be worth your
while to try what taking him away from the fogs might do for
him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Old Gladman seemed inclined to consider the question, but Mrs.
Gladman, a brisk, cheerful little woman, had made up her
mind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve had what there is to have,&rdquo; said Mrs.
Gladman.&nbsp; &ldquo;He&rsquo;s seventy-three.&nbsp;
What&rsquo;s the sense of risking good money?&nbsp; Be
content.&rdquo;</p>
<p>No one could say&mdash;no one ever did say&mdash;that Clodd,
under the circumstances, did not do his best.&nbsp; Perhaps,
after all, nothing could have helped.&nbsp; The little old
gentleman, at Clodd&rsquo;s suggestion, played at being a
dormouse and lay very still.&nbsp; If he grew restless, thereby
bringing on his cough, Clodd, as a terrible black cat, was
watching to pounce upon him.&nbsp; Only by keeping very quiet and
artfully pretending to be asleep could he hope to escape the
ruthless Clodd.</p>
<p>Doctor William Smith (n&eacute; Wilhelm Schmidt) shrugged his
fat shoulders.&nbsp; &ldquo;We can do noding.&nbsp; Dese fogs of
ours: id is de one ting dat enables the foreigner to crow over
us.&nbsp; Keep him quiet.&nbsp; De dormouse&mdash;id is a goot
idea.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That evening William Clodd mounted to the second floor of 16,
Gough Square, where dwelt his friend, Peter Hope, and knocked
briskly at the door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come in,&rdquo; said a decided voice, which was not
Peter Hope&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>Mr. William Clodd&rsquo;s ambition was, and always had been,
to be the owner or part-owner of a paper.&nbsp; To-day, as I have
said, he owns a quarter of a hundred, and is in negotiation, so
rumour goes, for seven more.&nbsp; But twenty years ago
&ldquo;Clodd and Co., Limited,&rdquo; was but in embryo.&nbsp;
And Peter Hope, journalist, had likewise and for many a long year
cherished the ambition to be, before he died, the owner or
part-owner of a paper.&nbsp; Peter Hope to-day owns nothing,
except perhaps the knowledge, if such things be permitted, that
whenever and wherever his name is mentioned, kind thoughts arise
unbidden&mdash;that someone of the party will surely say:
&ldquo;Dear old Peter!&nbsp; What a good fellow he
was!&rdquo;&nbsp; Which also may be in its way a valuable
possession: who knows?&nbsp; But twenty years ago Peter&rsquo;s
horizon was limited by Fleet Street.</p>
<p>Peter Hope was forty-seven, so he said, a dreamer and a
scholar.&nbsp; William Clodd was three-and-twenty, a born
hustler, very wide awake.&nbsp; Meeting one day by accident upon
an omnibus, when Clodd lent Peter, who had come out without his
purse, threepence to pay his fare with; drifting into
acquaintanceship, each had come to acquire a liking and respect
for the other.&nbsp; The dreamer thought with wonder of
Clodd&rsquo;s shrewd practicability; the cute young man of
business was lost in admiration of what seemed to him his old
friend&rsquo;s marvellous learning.&nbsp; Both had arrived at the
conclusion that a weekly journal with Peter Hope as editor, and
William Clodd as manager, would be bound to be successful.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If only we could scrape together a thousand
pounds!&rdquo; had sighed Peter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The moment we lay our hands upon the coin, we&rsquo;ll
start that paper.&nbsp; Remember, it&rsquo;s a bargain,&rdquo;
had answered William Clodd.</p>
<p>Mr. William Clodd turned the handle and walked in.&nbsp; With
the door still in his hand he paused to look round the
room.&nbsp; It was the first time he had seen it.&nbsp; His
meetings hitherto with Peter Hope had been chance
<i>rencontres</i> in street or restaurant.&nbsp; Always had he
been curious to view the sanctuary of so much erudition.</p>
<p>A large, oak-panelled room, its three high windows, each with
a low, cushioned seat beneath it, giving on to Gough
Square.&nbsp; Thirty-five years before, Peter Hope, then a young
dandy with side whiskers close-cropped and terminating just below
the ear; with wavy, brown hair, giving to his fresh-complexioned
face an appearance almost girlish; in cut-away blue coat,
flowered waistcoat, black silk cravat secured by two gold pins
chained together, and tightly strapped grey trouserings, had,
aided and abetted by a fragile little lady in crinoline and
much-flounced skirt, and bodice somewhat low, with corkscrew
curls each movement of her head set ringing, planned and
furnished it in accordance with the sober canons then in vogue,
spending thereupon more than they should, as is to be expected
from the young to whom the future promises all things.&nbsp; The
fine Brussels carpet!&nbsp; A little too bright, had thought the
shaking curls.&nbsp; &ldquo;The colours will tone down,
miss&mdash;ma&rsquo;am.&rdquo;&nbsp; The shopman knew.&nbsp; Only
by the help of the round island underneath the massive Empire
table, by excursions into untrodden corners, could Peter
recollect the rainbow floor his feet had pressed when he was
twenty-one.&nbsp; The noble bookcase, surmounted by
Minerva&rsquo;s bust.&nbsp; Really it was too expensive.&nbsp;
But the nodding curls had been so obstinate.&nbsp; Peter&rsquo;s
silly books and papers must be put away in order; the curls did
not intend to permit any excuse for untidiness.&nbsp; So, too,
the handsome, brass-bound desk; it must be worthy of the
beautiful thoughts Peter would pen upon it.&nbsp; The great
sideboard, supported by two such angry-looking mahogany lions; it
must be strong to support the weight of silver clever Peter would
one day purchase to place upon it.&nbsp; The few oil paintings in
their heavy frames.&nbsp; A solidly furnished, sober apartment;
about it that subtle atmosphere of dignity one finds but in old
rooms long undisturbed, where one seems to read upon the walls:
&ldquo;I, Joy and Sorrow, twain in one, have dwelt
here.&rdquo;&nbsp; One item only there was that seemed out of
place among its grave surroundings&mdash;a guitar, hanging from
the wall, ornamented with a ridiculous blue bow, somewhat
faded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. William Clodd?&rdquo; demanded the decided
voice.</p>
<p>Clodd started and closed the door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Guessed it in once,&rdquo; admitted Mr. Clodd.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought so,&rdquo; said the decided voice.&nbsp;
&ldquo;We got your note this afternoon.&nbsp; Mr. Hope will be
back at eight.&nbsp; Will you kindly hang up your hat and coat in
the hall?&nbsp; You will find a box of cigars on the
mantelpiece.&nbsp; Excuse my being busy.&nbsp; I must finish
this, then I&rsquo;ll talk to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The owner of the decided voice went on writing.&nbsp; Clodd,
having done as he was bid, sat himself in the easy-chair before
the fire and smoked.&nbsp; Of the person behind the desk Mr.
Clodd could see but the head and shoulders.&nbsp; It had black,
curly hair, cut short.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s only garment visible
below the white collar and red tie might have been a boy&rsquo;s
jacket designed more like a girl&rsquo;s, or a girl&rsquo;s
designed more like a boy&rsquo;s; partaking of the genius of
English statesmanship, it appeared to be a compromise.&nbsp; Mr.
Clodd remarked the long, drooping lashes over the bright, black
eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a girl,&rdquo; said Mr. Clodd to himself;
&ldquo;rather a pretty girl.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Clodd, continuing downward, arrived at the nose.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Mr. Clodd to himself, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s
a boy&mdash;a cheeky young beggar, I should say.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The person at the desk, giving a grunt of satisfaction,
gathered together sheets of manuscript and arranged them; then,
resting its elbows on the desk and taking its head between its
hands, regarded Mr. Clodd.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you hurry yourself,&rdquo; said Mr. Clodd;
&ldquo;but when you really have finished, tell me what you think
of me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I beg your pardon,&rdquo; apologised the person at the
desk.&nbsp; &ldquo;I have got into a habit of staring at
people.&nbsp; I know it&rsquo;s rude.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m trying to
break myself of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell me your name,&rdquo; suggested Mr. Clodd,
&ldquo;and I&rsquo;ll forgive you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tommy,&rdquo; was the answer&mdash;&ldquo;I mean
Jane.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Make up your mind,&rdquo; advised Mr. Clodd;
&ldquo;don&rsquo;t let me influence you.&nbsp; I only want the
truth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You see,&rdquo; explained the person at the desk,
&ldquo;everybody calls me Tommy, because that used to be my
name.&nbsp; But now it&rsquo;s Jane.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see,&rdquo; said Mr. Clodd.&nbsp; &ldquo;And which am
I to call you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The person at the desk pondered.&nbsp; &ldquo;Well, if this
scheme you and Mr. Hope have been talking about really comes to
anything, we shall be a good deal thrown together, you see, and
then I expect you&rsquo;ll call me Tommy&mdash;most people
do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve heard about the scheme?&nbsp; Mr. Hope has
told you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, of course,&rdquo; replied Tommy.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m Mr. Hope&rsquo;s devil.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For the moment Clodd doubted whether his old friend had not
started a rival establishment to his own.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I help him in his work,&rdquo; Tommy relieved his mind
by explaining.&nbsp; &ldquo;In journalistic circles we call it
devilling.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I understand,&rdquo; said Mr. Clodd.&nbsp; &ldquo;And
what do you think, Tommy, of the scheme?&nbsp; I may as well
start calling you Tommy, because, between you and me, I think the
idea will come to something.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tommy fixed her black eyes upon him.&nbsp; She seemed to be
looking him right through.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are staring again, Tommy,&rdquo; Clodd reminded
her.&nbsp; &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll have trouble breaking yourself of
that habit, I can see.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was trying to make up my mind about you.&nbsp;
Everything depends upon the business man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Glad to hear you say so,&rdquo; replied the
self-satisfied Clodd.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you are very clever&mdash;Do you mind coming nearer
to the lamp?&nbsp; I can&rsquo;t quite see you over
there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Clodd never could understand why he did it&mdash;never could
understand why, from first to last, he always did what Tommy
wished him to do; his only consolation being that other folks
seemed just as helpless.&nbsp; He rose and, crossing the long
room, stood at attention before the large desk, nervousness, to
which he was somewhat of a stranger, taking possession of
him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t <i>look</i> very clever.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Clodd experienced another new sensation&mdash;that of falling
in his own estimation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And yet one can see that you <i>are</i>
clever.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The mercury of Clodd&rsquo;s conceit shot upward to a point
that in the case of anyone less physically robust might have been
dangerous to health.</p>
<p>Clodd held out his hand.&nbsp; &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll pull it
through, Tommy.&nbsp; The Guv&rsquo;nor shall find the
literature; you and I will make it go.&nbsp; I like
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And Peter Hope, entering at the moment, caught a spark from
the light that shone in the eyes of William Clodd and Tommy,
whose other name was Jane, as, gripping hands, they stood with
the desk between them, laughing they knew not why.&nbsp; And the
years fell from old Peter, and, again a boy, he also laughed he
knew not why.&nbsp; He had sipped from the wine-cup of youth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all settled, Guv&rsquo;nor!&rdquo; cried
Clodd.&nbsp; &ldquo;Tommy and I have fixed things up.&nbsp;
We&rsquo;ll start with the New Year.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got the money?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m reckoning on it.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t see very
well how I can miss it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sufficient?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just about.&nbsp; You get to work.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve saved a little,&rdquo; began Peter.&nbsp;
&ldquo;It ought to have been more, but somehow it
isn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps we shall want it,&rdquo; Clodd replied;
&ldquo;perhaps we shan&rsquo;t.&nbsp; You are supplying the
brains.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The three for a few moments remained silent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think, Tommy,&rdquo; said Peter, &ldquo;I think a
bottle of the old Madeira&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not to-night,&rdquo; said Clodd; &ldquo;next
time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To drink success,&rdquo; urged Peter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One man&rsquo;s success generally means some other poor
devil&rsquo;s misfortune,&rdquo; answered Clodd.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t be helped, of course, but don&rsquo;t want
to think about it to-night.&nbsp; Must be getting back to my
dormouse.&nbsp; Good night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Clodd shook hands and bustled out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought as much,&rdquo; mused Peter aloud.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What an odd mixture the man is!&nbsp; Kind&mdash;no one
could have been kinder to the poor old fellow.&nbsp; Yet all the
while&mdash;We are an odd mixture, Tommy,&rdquo; said Peter Hope,
&ldquo;an odd mixture, we men and women.&rdquo;&nbsp; Peter was a
philosopher.</p>
<p>The white-whiskered old dormouse soon coughed himself to sleep
for ever.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall want you and the missis to come to the funeral,
Gladman,&rdquo; said Mr. Clodd, as he swung into the
stationer&rsquo;s shop; &ldquo;and bring Pincer with you.&nbsp;
I&rsquo;m writing to him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t see what good we can do,&rdquo; demurred
Gladman.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you three are his only relatives; it&rsquo;s only
decent you should be present,&rdquo; urged Clodd.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Besides, there&rsquo;s the will to be read.&nbsp; You may
care to hear it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The dry old law stationer opened wide his watery eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;His will!&nbsp; Why, what had he got to leave?&nbsp;
There was nothing but the annuity.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You turn up at the funeral,&rdquo; Clodd told him,
&ldquo;and you&rsquo;ll learn all about it.&nbsp; Bonner&rsquo;s
clerk will be there and will bring it with him.&nbsp; Everything
is going to be done <i>comme il faut</i>, as the French
say.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I ought to have known of this,&rdquo; began Mr.
Gladman.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Glad to find you taking so much interest in the old
chap,&rdquo; said Clodd.&nbsp; &ldquo;Pity he&rsquo;s dead and
can&rsquo;t thank you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I warn you,&rdquo; shouted old Gladman, whose voice was
rising to a scream, &ldquo;he was a helpless imbecile, incapable
of acting for himself!&nbsp; If any undue
influence&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;See you on Friday,&rdquo; broke in Clodd, who was
busy.</p>
<p>Friday&rsquo;s ceremony was not a sociable affair.&nbsp; Mrs.
Gladman spoke occasionally in a shrill whisper to Mr. Gladman,
who replied with grunts.&nbsp; Both employed the remainder of
their time in scowling at Clodd.&nbsp; Mr. Pincer, a stout, heavy
gentleman connected with the House of Commons, maintained a
ministerial reserve.&nbsp; The undertaker&rsquo;s foreman
expressed himself as thankful when it was over.&nbsp; He
criticised it as the humpiest funeral he had ever known; for a
time he had serious thoughts of changing his profession.</p>
<p>The solicitor&rsquo;s clerk was waiting for the party on its
return from Kensal Green.&nbsp; Clodd again offered
hospitality.&nbsp; Mr. Pincer this time allowed himself a glass
of weak whisky-and-water, and sipped it with an air of doing so
without prejudice.&nbsp; The clerk had one a little stronger,
Mrs. Gladman, dispensing with consultation, declined shrilly for
self and partner.&nbsp; Clodd, explaining that he always followed
legal precedent, mixed himself one also and drank &ldquo;To our
next happy meeting.&rdquo;&nbsp; Then the clerk read.</p>
<p>It was a short and simple will, dated the previous
August.&nbsp; It appeared that the old gentleman, unknown to his
relatives, had died possessed of shares in a silver mine, once
despaired of, now prospering.&nbsp; Taking them at present value,
they would produce a sum well over two thousand pounds.&nbsp; The
old gentleman had bequeathed five hundred pounds to his
brother-in-law, Mr. Gladman; five hundred pounds to his only
other living relative, his first cousin, Mr. Pincer; the residue
to his friend, William Clodd, as a return for the many kindnesses
that gentleman had shown him.</p>
<p>Mr. Gladman rose, more amused than angry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you think you are going to pocket that one thousand
to twelve hundred pounds.&nbsp; You really do?&rdquo; he asked
Mr. Clodd, who, with legs stretched out before him, sat with his
hands deep in his trousers pockets.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the idea,&rdquo; admitted Mr. Clodd.</p>
<p>Mr. Gladman laughed, but without much lightening the
atmosphere.&nbsp; &ldquo;Upon my word, Clodd, you amuse
me&mdash;you quite amuse me,&rdquo; repeated Mr. Gladman.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You always had a sense of humour,&rdquo; commented Mr.
Clodd.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You villain!&nbsp; You double-dyed villain!&rdquo;
screamed Mr. Gladman, suddenly changing his tone.&nbsp;
&ldquo;You think the law is going to allow you to swindle honest
men!&nbsp; You think we are going to sit still for you to rob
us!&nbsp; That will&mdash;&rdquo;&nbsp; Mr. Gladman pointed a
lank forefinger dramatically towards the table.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mean to dispute it?&rdquo; inquired Mr. Clodd.</p>
<p>For a moment Mr. Gladman stood aghast at the other&rsquo;s
coolness, but soon found his voice again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dispute it!&rdquo; he shrieked.&nbsp; &ldquo;Do you
dispute that you influenced him?&mdash;dictated it to him word
for word, made the poor old helpless idiot sign it, he utterly
incapable of even understanding&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t chatter so much,&rdquo; interrupted Mr.
Clodd.&nbsp; &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not a pretty voice, yours.&nbsp;
What I asked you was, do you intend to dispute it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you will kindly excuse us,&rdquo; struck in Mrs.
Gladman, addressing Mr. Clodd with an air of much politeness,
&ldquo;we shall just have time, if we go now, to catch our
solicitor before he leaves his office.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Gladman took up his hat from underneath his chair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One moment,&rdquo; suggested Mr. Clodd.&nbsp; &ldquo;I
did influence him to make that will.&nbsp; If you don&rsquo;t
like it, there&rsquo;s an end of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; commenced Mr. Gladman in a mollified
tone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sit down,&rdquo; suggested Mr. Clodd.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s try another one.&rdquo;&nbsp; Mr. Clodd turned
to the clerk.&nbsp; &ldquo;The previous one, Mr. Wright, if you
please; the one dated June the 10th.&rdquo;</p>
<p>An equally short and simple document, it bequeathed three
hundred pounds to Mr. William Clodd in acknowledgment of
kindnesses received, the residue to the Royal Zoological Society
of London, the deceased having been always interested in and fond
of animals.&nbsp; The relatives, &ldquo;Who have never shown me
the slightest affection or given themselves the slightest trouble
concerning me, and who have already received considerable sums
out of my income,&rdquo; being by name excluded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I may mention,&rdquo; observed Mr. Clodd, no one else
appearing inclined to break the silence, &ldquo;that in
suggesting the Royal Zoological Society to my poor old friend as
a fitting object for his benevolence, I had in mind a very
similar case that occurred five years ago.&nbsp; A bequest to
them was disputed on the grounds that the testator was of unsound
mind.&nbsp; They had to take their case to the House of Lords
before they finally won it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Anyhow,&rdquo; remarked Mr. Gladman, licking his lips,
which were dry, &ldquo;you won&rsquo;t get anything, Mr.
Clodd&mdash;no, not even your three-hundred pounds, clever as you
think yourself.&nbsp; My brother-in-law&rsquo;s money will go to
the lawyers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then Mr. Pincer rose and spoke slowly and clearly.&nbsp;
&ldquo;If there must be a lunatic connected with our family,
which I don&rsquo;t see why there should be, it seems to me to be
you, Nathaniel Gladman.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Gladman stared back with open mouth.&nbsp; Mr. Pincer went
on impressively.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As for my poor old cousin Joe, he had his
eccentricities, but that was all.&nbsp; I for one am prepared to
swear that he was of sound mind in August last and quite capable
of making his own will.&nbsp; It seems to me that the other
thing, dated in June, is just waste paper.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Pincer having delivered himself, sat down again.&nbsp; Mr.
Gladman showed signs of returning language.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! what&rsquo;s the use of quarrelling?&rdquo; chirped
in cheery Mrs. Gladman.&nbsp; &ldquo;It&rsquo;s five hundred
pounds we never expected.&nbsp; Live and let live is what I
always say.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the damned artfulness of the thing,&rdquo;
said Mr. Gladman, still very white about the gills.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, you have a little something to thaw your
face,&rdquo; suggested his wife.</p>
<p>Mr. and Mrs. Gladman, on the strength of the five hundred
pounds, went home in a cab.&nbsp; Mr. Pincer stayed behind and
made a night of it with Mr. Clodd and Bonner&rsquo;s clerk, at
Clodd&rsquo;s expense.</p>
<p>The residue worked out at eleven hundred and sixty-nine pounds
and a few shillings.&nbsp; The capital of the new company,
&ldquo;established for the purpose of carrying on the business of
newspaper publishers and distributors, printers, advertising
agents, and any other trade and enterprise affiliated to the
same,&rdquo; was one thousand pounds in one pound shares, fully
paid up; of which William Clodd, Esquire, was registered
proprietor of four hundred and sixty-three; Peter Hope, M.A., of
16, Gough Square, of also four hundred and sixty-three; Miss Jane
Hope, adopted daughter of said Peter Hope (her real name nobody,
herself included, ever having known), and generally called Tommy,
of three, paid for by herself after a battle royal with William
Clodd; Mrs. Postwhistle, of Rolls Court, of ten, presented by the
promoter; Mr. Pincer, of the House of Commons, also of ten (still
owing for); Dr. Smith (n&eacute; Schmidt) of fifty; James Douglas
Alexander Calder McTear (otherwise the &ldquo;Wee Laddie&rdquo;),
residing then in Mrs. Postwhistle&rsquo;s first floor front, of
one, paid for by poem published in the first number: &ldquo;The
Song of the Pen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Choosing a title for the paper cost much thought.&nbsp; Driven
to despair, they called it <i>Good Humour</i>.</p>
<h2>STORY THE THIRD&mdash;Grindley Junior drops into the Position
of Publisher</h2>
<p>Few are the ways of the West Central district that have
changed less within the last half-century than Nevill&rsquo;s
Court, leading from Great New Street into Fetter Lane.&nbsp; Its
north side still consists of the same quaint row of small low
shops that stood there&mdash;doing perhaps a little brisker
business&mdash;when George the Fourth was King; its southern side
of the same three substantial houses each behind a strip of
garden, pleasant by contrast with surrounding grimness, built
long ago&mdash;some say before Queen Anne was dead.</p>
<p>Out of the largest of these, passing through the garden, then
well cared for, came one sunny Sunday morning, some fifteen years
before the commencement proper of this story, one Solomon
Appleyard, pushing in front of him a perambulator.&nbsp; At the
brick wall surmounted by wooden railings that divides the garden
from the court, Solomon paused, hearing behind him the voice of
Mrs. Appleyard speaking from the doorstep.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I don&rsquo;t see you again until dinner-time,
I&rsquo;ll try and get on without you, understand.&nbsp;
Don&rsquo;t think of nothing but your pipe and forget the
child.&nbsp; And be careful of the crossings.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Appleyard retired into the darkness.&nbsp; Solomon,
steering the perambulator carefully, emerged from Nevill&rsquo;s
Court without accident.&nbsp; The quiet streets drew Solomon
westward.&nbsp; A vacant seat beneath the shade overlooking the
Long Water in Kensington Gardens invited to rest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Piper?&rdquo; suggested a small boy to Solomon.&nbsp;
&ldquo;<i>Sunday Times</i>, <i>&rsquo;Server</i>?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My boy,&rdquo; said Mr. Appleyard, speaking slowly,
&ldquo;when you&rsquo;ve been mewed up with newspapers eighteen
hours a day for six days a week, you can do without &rsquo;em for
a morning.&nbsp; Take &rsquo;em away.&nbsp; I want to forget the
smell of &rsquo;em.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Solomon, having assured himself that the party in the
perambulator was still breathing, crossed his legs and lit his
pipe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hezekiah!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The exclamation had been wrung from Solomon Appleyard by the
approach of a stout, short man clad in a remarkably ill-fitting
broad-cloth suit.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What, Sol, my boy?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It looked like you,&rdquo; said Solomon.&nbsp;
&ldquo;And then I said to myself: &lsquo;No; surely it
can&rsquo;t be Hezekiah; he&rsquo;ll be at
chapel.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You run about,&rdquo; said Hezekiah, addressing a youth
of some four summers he had been leading by the hand.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you go out of my sight; and whatever you do,
don&rsquo;t you do injury to those new clothes of yours, or
you&rsquo;ll wish you&rsquo;d never been put into them.&nbsp; The
truth is,&rdquo; continued Hezekiah to his friend, his sole
surviving son and heir being out of earshot, &ldquo;the morning
tempted me.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tain&rsquo;t often I get a bit of fresh
air.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Doing well?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The business,&rdquo; replied Hezekiah, &ldquo;is going
up by leaps and bounds&mdash;leaps and bounds.&nbsp; But, of
course, all that means harder work for me.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s from
six in the morning till twelve o&rsquo;clock at night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s nothing I know of,&rdquo; returned
Solomon, who was something of a pessimist, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s
given away free gratis for nothing except misfortune.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Keeping yourself up to the mark ain&rsquo;t too
easy,&rdquo; continued Hezekiah; &ldquo;and when it comes to
other folks! play&rsquo;s all they think of.&nbsp; Talk religion
to them&mdash;why, they laugh at you!&nbsp; What the
world&rsquo;s coming to, I don&rsquo;t know.&nbsp; How&rsquo;s
the printing business doing?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The printing business,&rdquo; responded the other,
removing his pipe and speaking somewhat sadly, &ldquo;the
printing business looks like being a big thing.&nbsp; Capital, of
course, is what hampers me&mdash;or, rather, the want of
it.&nbsp; But Janet, she&rsquo;s careful; she don&rsquo;t waste
much, Janet don&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, with Anne,&rdquo; replied Hezekiah,
&ldquo;it&rsquo;s all the other way&mdash;pleasure, gaiety, a day
at Rosherville or the Crystal Palace&mdash;anything to waste
money.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah! she was always fond of her bit of fun,&rdquo;
remembered Solomon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fun!&rdquo; retorted Hezekiah.&nbsp; &ldquo;I like a
bit of fun myself.&nbsp; But not if you&rsquo;ve got to pay for
it.&nbsp; Where&rsquo;s the fun in that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What I ask myself sometimes,&rdquo; said Solomon,
looking straight in front of him, &ldquo;is what do we do it
for?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do we do what for?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Work like blessed slaves, depriving ourselves of all
enjoyments.&nbsp; What&rsquo;s the sense of it?&nbsp;
What&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>A voice from the perambulator beside him broke the thread of
Solomon Appleyard&rsquo;s discourse.&nbsp; The sole surviving son
of Hezekiah Grindley, seeking distraction and finding none, had
crept back unperceived.&nbsp; A perambulator!&nbsp; A thing his
experience told him out of which excitement in some form or
another could generally be obtained.&nbsp; You worried it and
took your chance.&nbsp; Either it howled, in which case you had
to run for your life, followed&mdash;and, unfortunately,
overtaken nine times out of ten&mdash;by a whirlwind of
vengeance; or it gurgled: in which case the heavens smiled and
halos descended on your head.&nbsp; In either event you escaped
the deadly ennui that is the result of continuous virtue.&nbsp;
Master Grindley, his star having pointed out to him a
peacock&rsquo;s feather lying on the ground, had, with one eye
upon his unobservant parent, removed the complicated coverings
sheltering Miss Helvetia Appleyard from the world, and
anticipating by a quarter of a century the prime enjoyment of
British youth, had set to work to tickle that lady on the
nose.&nbsp; Miss Helvetia Appleyard awakened, did precisely what
the tickled British maiden of to-day may be relied upon to do
under corresponding circumstances: she first of all took swift
and comprehensive survey of the male thing behind the
feather.&nbsp; Had he been displeasing in her eyes, she would,
one may rely upon it, have anteceded the behaviour in similar
case of her descendant of to-day&mdash;that is to say, have
expressed resentment in no uncertain terms.&nbsp; Master
Nathaniel Grindley proving, however, to her taste, that which
might have been considered impertinence became accepted as a fit
and proper form of introduction.&nbsp; Miss Appleyard smiled
graciously&mdash;nay, further, intimated desire for more.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That your only one?&rdquo; asked the paternal
Grindley.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s the only one,&rdquo; replied Solomon,
speaking in tones less pessimistic.</p>
<p>Miss Appleyard had with the help of Grindley junior wriggled
herself into a sitting posture.&nbsp; Grindley junior continued
his attentions, the lady indicating by signs the various points
at which she was most susceptible.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pretty picture they make together, eh?&rdquo; suggested
Hezekiah in a whisper to his friend.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never saw her take to anyone like that before,&rdquo;
returned Solomon, likewise in a whisper.</p>
<p>A neighbouring church clock chimed twelve.&nbsp; Solomon
Appleyard, knocking the ashes from his pipe, arose.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t know any reason myself why we
shouldn&rsquo;t see a little more of one another than we
do,&rdquo; suggested Grindley senior, shaking hands.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Give us a look-up one Sunday afternoon,&rdquo;
suggested Solomon.&nbsp; &ldquo;Bring the youngster with
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Solomon Appleyard and Hezekiah Grindley had started life
within a few months of one another some five-and-thirty years
before.&nbsp; Likewise within a few hundred yards of one another,
Solomon at his father&rsquo;s bookselling and printing
establishment on the east side of the High Street of a small
Yorkshire town; Hezekiah at his father&rsquo;s grocery shop upon
the west side, opposite.&nbsp; Both had married farmers&rsquo;
daughters.&nbsp; Solomon&rsquo;s natural bent towards gaiety Fate
had corrected by directing his affections to a partner instinct
with Yorkshire shrewdness; and with shrewdness go other qualities
that make for success rather than for happiness.&nbsp; Hezekiah,
had circumstances been equal, might have been his friend&rsquo;s
rival for Janet&rsquo;s capable and saving hand, had not
sweet-tempered, laughing Annie Glossop&mdash;directed by
Providence to her moral welfare, one must presume&mdash;fallen in
love with him.&nbsp; Between Jane&rsquo;s virtues and
Annie&rsquo;s three hundred golden sovereigns Hezekiah had not
hesitated a moment.&nbsp; Golden sovereigns were solid facts;
wifely virtues, by a serious-minded and strong-willed husband,
could be instilled&mdash;at all events, light-heartedness
suppressed.&nbsp; The two men, Hezekiah urged by his own
ambition, Solomon by his wife&rsquo;s, had arrived in London
within a year of one another: Hezekiah to open a grocer&rsquo;s
shop in Kensington, which those who should have known assured him
was a hopeless neighbourhood.&nbsp; But Hezekiah had the instinct
of the money-maker.&nbsp; Solomon, after looking about him, had
fixed upon the roomy, substantial house in Nevill&rsquo;s Court
as a promising foundation for a printer&rsquo;s business.</p>
<p>That was ten years ago.&nbsp; The two friends, scorning
delights, living laborious days, had seen but little of one
another.&nbsp; Light-hearted Annie had borne to her dour partner
two children who had died.&nbsp; Nathaniel George, with the luck
supposed to wait on number three, had lived on, and, inheriting
fortunately the temperament of his mother, had brought sunshine
into the gloomy rooms above the shop in High Street,
Kensington.&nbsp; Mrs. Grindley, grown weak and fretful, had
rested from her labours.</p>
<p>Mrs. Appleyard&rsquo;s guardian angel, prudent like his
prot&eacute;g&eacute;, had waited till Solomon&rsquo;s business
was well established before despatching the stork to
Nevill&rsquo;s Court, with a little girl.&nbsp; Later had sent a
boy, who, not finding the close air of St. Dunstan to his liking,
had found his way back again; thus passing out of this story and
all others.&nbsp; And there remained to carry on the legend of
the Grindleys and the Appleyards only Nathaniel George, now aged
five, and Janet Helvetia, quite a beginner, who took lift
seriously.</p>
<p>There are no such things as facts.&nbsp; Narrow-minded
folk&mdash;surveyors, auctioneers, and such like&mdash;would have
insisted that the garden between the old Georgian house and
Nevill&rsquo;s Court was a strip of land one hundred and eighteen
feet by ninety-two, containing a laburnum tree, six laurel
bushes, and a dwarf deodora.&nbsp; To Nathaniel George and Janet
Helvetia it was the land of Thule, &ldquo;the furthest boundaries
of which no man has reached.&rdquo;&nbsp; On rainy Sunday
afternoons they played in the great, gloomy pressroom, where
silent ogres, standing motionless, stretched out iron arms to
seize them as they ran.&nbsp; Then just when Nathaniel George was
eight, and Janet Helvetia four and a half, Hezekiah launched the
celebrated &ldquo;Grindley&rsquo;s Sauce.&rdquo;&nbsp; It added a
relish to chops and steaks, transformed cold mutton into a
luxury, and swelled the head of Hezekiah Grindley&mdash;which was
big enough in all conscience as it was&mdash;and shrivelled up
his little hard heart.&nbsp; The Grindleys and the Appleyards
visited no more.&nbsp; As a sensible fellow ought to have seen
for himself, so thought Hezekiah, the Sauce had altered all
things.&nbsp; The possibility of a marriage between their
children, things having remained equal, might have been a pretty
fancy; but the son of the great Grindley, whose name in
three-foot letters faced the world from every hoarding, would
have to look higher than a printer&rsquo;s daughter.&nbsp;
Solomon, a sudden and vehement convert to the principles of
medi&aelig;val feudalism, would rather see his only child,
granddaughter of the author of <i>The History of Kettlewell</i>
and other works, dead and buried than married to a grocer&rsquo;s
son, even though he might inherit a fortune made out of poisoning
the public with a mixture of mustard and sour beer.&nbsp; It was
many years before Nathaniel George and Janet Helvetia met one
another again, and when they did they had forgotten one
another.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">* * * * *</p>
<p>Hezekiah S. Grindley, a short, stout, and pompous gentleman,
sat under a palm in the gorgeously furnished drawing-room of his
big house at Notting Hill.&nbsp; Mrs. Grindley, a thin, faded
woman, the despair of her dressmaker, sat as near to the fire as
its massive and imposing copper outworks would permit, and
shivered.&nbsp; Grindley junior, a fair-haired, well-shaped
youth, with eyes that the other sex found attractive, leant with
his hands in his pockets against a scrupulously robed statue of
Diana, and appeared uncomfortable.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m making the money&mdash;making it hand over
fist.&nbsp; All you&rsquo;ll have to do will be to spend
it,&rdquo; Grindley senior was explaining to his son and
heir.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll do that all right, dad.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not so sure of it,&rdquo; was his
father&rsquo;s opinion.&nbsp; &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got to prove
yourself worthy to spend it.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t you think I shall
be content to have slaved all these years merely to provide a
brainless young idiot with the means of self-indulgence.&nbsp; I
leave my money to somebody worthy of me.&nbsp; Understand,
sir?&mdash;somebody worthy of me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Grindley commenced a sentence; Mr. Grindley turned his
small eyes upon her.&nbsp; The sentence remained unfinished.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You were about to say something,&rdquo; her husband
reminded her.</p>
<p>Mrs. Grindley said it was nothing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If it is anything worth hearing&mdash;if it is anything
that will assist the discussion, let&rsquo;s have
it.&rdquo;&nbsp; Mr. Grindley waited.&nbsp; &ldquo;If not, if you
yourself do not consider it worth finishing, why have begun
it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Grindley returned to his son and heir.&nbsp; &ldquo;You
haven&rsquo;t done too well at school&mdash;in fact, your school
career has disappointed me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know I&rsquo;m not clever,&rdquo; Grindley junior
offered as an excuse.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why not?&nbsp; Why aren&rsquo;t you clever?&rdquo;</p>
<p>His son and heir was unable to explain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are my son&mdash;why aren&rsquo;t you clever?&nbsp;
It&rsquo;s laziness, sir; sheer laziness!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll try and do better at Oxford,
sir&mdash;honour bright I will!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You had better,&rdquo; advised him his father;
&ldquo;because I warn you, your whole future depends upon
it.&nbsp; You know me.&nbsp; You&rsquo;ve got to be a credit to
me, to be worthy of the name of Grindley&mdash;or the name, my
boy, is all you&rsquo;ll have.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Old Grindley meant it, and his son knew that he meant
it.&nbsp; The old Puritan principles and instincts were strong in
the old gentleman&mdash;formed, perhaps, the better part of
him.&nbsp; Idleness was an abomination to him; devotion to
pleasure, other than the pleasure of money-making, a grievous sin
in his eyes.&nbsp; Grindley junior fully intended to do well at
Oxford, and might have succeeded.&nbsp; In accusing himself of
lack of cleverness, he did himself an injustice.&nbsp; He had
brains, he had energy, he had character.&nbsp; Our virtues can be
our stumbling-blocks as well as our vices.&nbsp; Young Grindley
had one admirable virtue that needs, above all others, careful
controlling: he was amiability itself.&nbsp; Before the charm and
sweetness of it, Oxford snobbishness went down.&nbsp; The Sauce,
against the earnest counsel of its own advertisement, was
forgotten; the pickles passed by.&nbsp; To escape the natural
result of his popularity would have needed a stronger will than
young Grindley possessed.&nbsp; For a time the true state of
affairs was hidden from the eye of Grindley senior.&nbsp; To
&ldquo;slack&rdquo; it this term, with the full determination of
&ldquo;swotting&rdquo; it the next, is always easy; the
difficulty beginning only with the new term.&nbsp; Possibly with
luck young Grindley might have retrieved his position and covered
up the traces of his folly, but for an unfortunate
accident.&nbsp; Returning to college with some other choice
spirits at two o&rsquo;clock in the morning, it occurred to young
Grindley that trouble might be saved all round by cutting out a
pane of glass with a diamond ring and entering his rooms, which
were on the ground-floor, by the window.&nbsp; That, in mistake
for his own, he should have selected the bedroom of the College
Rector was a misfortune that might have occurred to anyone who
had commenced the evening on champagne and finished it on
whisky.&nbsp; Young Grindley, having been warned already twice
before, was &ldquo;sent down.&rdquo;&nbsp; And then, of course,
the whole history of the three wasted years came out.&nbsp; Old
Grindley in his study chair having talked for half an hour at the
top of his voice, chose, partly by reason of physical necessity,
partly by reason of dormant dramatic instinct, to speak quietly
and slowly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll give you one chance more, my boy, and one
only.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve tried you as a gentleman&mdash;perhaps
that was my mistake.&nbsp; Now I&rsquo;ll try you as a
grocer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As a what?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As a grocer, sir&mdash;g-r-o-c-e-r&mdash;grocer, a man
who stands behind a counter in a white apron and his
shirt-sleeves; who sells tea and sugar and candied peel and
such-like things to customers&mdash;old ladies, little girls; who
rises at six in the morning, takes down the shutters, sweeps out
the shop, cleans the windows; who has half an hour for his dinner
of corned beef and bread; who puts up the shutters at ten
o&rsquo;clock at night, tidies up the shop, has his supper, and
goes to bed, feeling his day has not been wasted.&nbsp; I meant
to spare you.&nbsp; I was wrong.&nbsp; You shall go through the
mill as I went through it.&nbsp; If at the end of two years
you&rsquo;ve done well with your time, learned
something&mdash;learned to be a man, at all events&mdash;you can
come to me and thank me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid, sir,&rdquo; suggested Grindley
junior, whose handsome face during the last few minutes had grown
very white, &ldquo;I might not make a very satisfactory
grocer.&nbsp; You see, sir, I&rsquo;ve had no
experience.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am glad you have some sense,&rdquo; returned his
father drily.&nbsp; &ldquo;You are quite right.&nbsp; Even a
grocer&rsquo;s business requires learning.&nbsp; It will cost me
a little money; but it will be the last I shall ever spend upon
you.&nbsp; For the first year you will have to be apprenticed,
and I shall allow you something to live on.&nbsp; It shall be
more than I had at your age&mdash;we&rsquo;ll say a pound a
week.&nbsp; After that I shall expect you to keep
yourself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Grindley senior rose.&nbsp; &ldquo;You need not give me your
answer till the evening.&nbsp; You are of age.&nbsp; I have no
control over you unless you are willing to agree.&nbsp; You can
go my way, or you can go your own.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Young Grindley, who had inherited a good deal of his
father&rsquo;s grit, felt very much inclined to go his own; but,
hampered on the other hand by the sweetness of disposition he had
inherited from his mother, was unable to withstand the argument
of that lady&rsquo;s tears, so that evening accepted old
Grindley&rsquo;s terms, asking only as a favour that the scene of
his probation might be in some out-of-the-way neighbourhood where
there would be little chance of his being met by old friends.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have thought of all that,&rdquo; answered his
father.&nbsp; &ldquo;My object isn&rsquo;t to humiliate you more
than is necessary for your good.&nbsp; The shop I have already
selected, on the assumption that you would submit, is as quiet
and out-of-the-way as you could wish.&nbsp; It is in a turning
off Fetter Lane, where you&rsquo;ll see few other people than
printers and caretakers.&nbsp; You&rsquo;ll lodge with a woman, a
Mrs. Postwhistle, who seems a very sensible person.&nbsp;
She&rsquo;ll board you and lodge you, and every Saturday
you&rsquo;ll receive a post-office order for six shillings, out
of which you&rsquo;ll find yourself in clothes.&nbsp; You can
take with you sufficient to last you for the first six months,
but no more.&nbsp; At the end of the year you can change if you
like and go to another shop, or make your own arrangements with
Mrs. Postwhistle.&nbsp; If all is settled, you go there
to-morrow.&nbsp; You go out of this house to-morrow in any
event.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Postwhistle was a large, placid lady of philosophic
temperament.&nbsp; Hitherto the little grocer&rsquo;s shop in
Rolls Court, Fetter Lane, had been easy of management by her own
unaided efforts; but the neighbourhood was rapidly
changing.&nbsp; Other grocers&rsquo; shops were disappearing one
by one, making way for huge blocks of buildings, where hundreds
of iron presses, singing day and night, spread to the earth the
song of the Mighty Pen.&nbsp; There were hours when the little
shop could hardly accommodate its crowd of customers.&nbsp; Mrs.
Postwhistle, of a bulk not to be moved quickly, had, after mature
consideration, conquering a natural disinclination to change,
decided to seek assistance.</p>
<p>Young Grindley, alighting from a four-wheeled cab in Fetter
Lane, marched up the court, followed by a weak-kneed wastrel
staggering under the weight of a small box.&nbsp; In the doorway
of the little shop, young Grindley paused and raised his hat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mrs. Postwhistle?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The lady, from her chair behind the counter, rose slowly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am Mr. Nathaniel Grindley, the new
assistant.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The weak-kneed wastrel let fall the box with a thud upon the
floor.&nbsp; Mrs. Postwhistle looked her new assistant up and
down.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; said Mrs. Postwhistle.&nbsp; &ldquo;Well, I
shouldn&rsquo;t &rsquo;ave felt instinctively it must be you, not
if I&rsquo;d &rsquo;ad to pick you out of a crowd.&nbsp; But if
you tell me so, why, I suppose you are.&nbsp; Come in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The weak-kneed wastrel, receiving to his astonishment a
shilling, departed.</p>
<p>Grindley senior had selected wisely.&nbsp; Mrs.
Postwhistle&rsquo;s theory was that although very few people in
this world understood their own business, they understood it
better than anyone else could understand it for them.&nbsp; If
handsome, well-educated young gentlemen, who gave shillings to
wastrels, felt they wanted to become smart and capable
grocers&rsquo; assistants, that was their affair.&nbsp; Her
business was to teach them their work, and, for her own sake, to
see that they did it.&nbsp; A month went by.&nbsp; Mrs.
Postwhistle found her new assistant hard-working, willing,
somewhat clumsy, but with a smile and a laugh that transformed
mistakes, for which another would have been soundly rated, into
welcome variations of the day&rsquo;s monotony.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you were the sort of woman that cared to make your
fortune,&rdquo; said one William Clodd, an old friend of Mrs.
Postwhistle&rsquo;s, young Grindley having descended into the
cellar to grind coffee, &ldquo;I&rsquo;d tell you what to
do.&nbsp; Take a bun-shop somewhere in the neighbourhood of a
girls&rsquo; school, and put that assistant of yours in the
window.&nbsp; You&rsquo;d do a roaring business.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a mystery about &rsquo;im,&rdquo; said
Mrs. Postwhistle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Know what it is?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I knew what it was, I shouldn&rsquo;t be calling it
a mystery,&rdquo; replied Mrs. Postwhistle, who was a stylist in
her way.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How did you get him?&nbsp; Win him in a
raffle?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jones, the agent, sent &rsquo;im to me all in a
&rsquo;urry.&nbsp; An assistant is what I really wanted, not an
apprentice; but the premium was good, and the references
everything one could desire.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Grindley, Grindley,&rdquo; murmured Clodd.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Any relation to the Sauce, I wonder?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A bit more wholesome, I should say, from the look of
him,&rdquo; thought Mrs. Postwhistle.</p>
<p>The question of a post office to meet its growing need had
long been under discussion by the neighbourhood.&nbsp; Mrs.
Postwhistle was approached upon the subject.&nbsp; Grindley
junior, eager for anything that might bring variety into his new,
cramped existence, undertook to qualify himself.</p>
<p>Within two months the arrangements were complete.&nbsp;
Grindley junior divided his time between dispensing groceries and
despatching telegrams and letters, and was grateful for the
change.</p>
<p>Grindley junior&rsquo;s mind was fixed upon the fashioning of
a cornucopia to receive a quarter of a pound of moist.&nbsp; The
customer, an extremely young lady, was seeking to hasten his
operations by tapping incessantly with a penny on the
counter.&nbsp; It did not hurry him; it only worried him.&nbsp;
Grindley junior had not acquired facility in the fashioning of
cornucopias&mdash;the vertex would invariably become unrolled at
the last moment, allowing the contents to dribble out on to the
floor or counter.&nbsp; Grindley junior was sweet-tempered as a
rule, but when engaged upon the fashioning of a cornucopia, was
irritable.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hurry up, old man!&rdquo; urged the extremely young
lady.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got another appointment in less
than half an hour.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, damn the thing!&rdquo; said Grindley junior, as the
paper for the fourth time reverted to its original shape.</p>
<p>An older lady, standing behind the extremely young lady and
holding a telegram-form in her hand, looked indignant.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Temper, temper,&rdquo; remarked the extremely young
lady in reproving tone.</p>
<p>The fifth time was more successful.&nbsp; The extremely young
lady went out, commenting upon the waste of time always resulting
when boys were employed to do the work of men.&nbsp; The older
lady, a haughty person, handed across her telegram with the
request that it should be sent off at once.</p>
<p>Grindley junior took his pencil from his pocket and commenced
to count.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Digniori</i>, not <i>digniorus</i>,&rdquo; commented
Grindley junior, correcting the word, &ldquo;<i>datur
digniori</i>, dative singular.&rdquo;&nbsp; Grindley junior,
still irritable from the struggle with the cornucopia, spoke
sharply.</p>
<p>The haughty lady withdrew her eyes from a spot some ten miles
beyond the back of the shop, where hitherto they had been
resting, and fixed them for the first time upon Grindley
junior.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; said the haughty lady.</p>
<p>Grindley junior looked up and immediately, to his annoyance,
felt that he was blushing.&nbsp; Grindley junior blushed
easily&mdash;it annoyed him very much.</p>
<p>The haughty young lady also blushed.&nbsp; She did not often
blush; when she did, she felt angry with herself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A shilling and a penny,&rdquo; demanded Grindley
junior.</p>
<p>The haughty young lady counted out the money and
departed.&nbsp; Grindley junior, peeping from behind a tin of
Abernethy biscuits, noticed that as she passed the window she
turned and looked back.&nbsp; She was a very pretty, haughty
lady.&nbsp; Grindley junior rather admired dark, level brows and
finely cut, tremulous lips, especially when combined with a mass
of soft, brown hair, and a rich olive complexion that flushed and
paled as one looked at it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Might send that telegram off if you&rsquo;ve nothing
else to do, and there&rsquo;s no particular reason for keeping it
back,&rdquo; suggested Mrs. Postwhistle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s only just been handed in,&rdquo; explained
Grindley junior, somewhat hurt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve been looking at it for the last five
minutes by the clock,&rdquo; said Mrs. Postwhistle.</p>
<p>Grindley junior sat down to the machine.&nbsp; The name and
address of the sender was Helvetia Appleyard, Nevill&rsquo;s
Court.</p>
<p>Three days passed&mdash;singularly empty days they appeared to
Grindley junior.&nbsp; On the fourth, Helvetia Appleyard had
occasion to despatch another telegram&mdash;this time entirely in
English.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One-and-fourpence,&rdquo; sighed Grindley junior.</p>
<p>Miss Appleyard drew forth her purse.&nbsp; The shop was
empty.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How did you come to know Latin?&rdquo; inquired Miss
Appleyard in quite a casual tone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I picked up a little at school.&nbsp; It was a phrase I
happened to remember,&rdquo; confessed Grindley junior, wondering
why he should be feeling ashamed of himself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am always sorry,&rdquo; said Miss Appleyard,
&ldquo;when I see anyone content with the lower life whose
talents might, perhaps, fit him for the higher.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Something about the tone and manner of Miss Appleyard reminded
Grindley junior of his former Rector.&nbsp; Each seemed to have
arrived by different roads at the same philosophical aloofness
from the world, tempered by chastened interest in human
phenomena.&nbsp; &ldquo;Would you like to try to raise
yourself&mdash;to improve yourself&mdash;to educate
yourself?&rdquo;</p>
<p>An unseen little rogue, who was enjoying himself immensely,
whispered to Grindley junior to say nothing but
&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he should.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will you let me help you?&rdquo; asked Miss
Appleyard.&nbsp; And the simple and heartfelt gratitude with
which Grindley junior closed upon the offer proved to Miss
Appleyard how true it is that to do good to others is the highest
joy.</p>
<p>Miss Appleyard had come prepared for possible
acceptance.&nbsp; &ldquo;You had better begin with this,&rdquo;
thought Miss Appleyard.&nbsp; &ldquo;I have marked the passages
that you should learn by heart.&nbsp; Make a note of anything you
do not understand, and I will explain it to you when&mdash;when
next I happen to be passing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Grindley junior took the book&mdash;<i>Bell&rsquo;s
Introduction to the Study of the Classics</i>, <i>for Use of
Beginners</i>&mdash;and held it between both hands.&nbsp; Its
price was ninepence, but Grindley junior appeared to regard it as
a volume of great value.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It will be hard work at first,&rdquo; Miss Appleyard
warned him; &ldquo;but you must persevere.&nbsp; I have taken an
interest in you; you must try not to disappoint me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And Miss Appleyard, feeling all the sensations of a Hypatia,
departed, taking light with her and forgetting to pay for the
telegram.&nbsp; Miss Appleyard belonged to the class that young
ladies who pride themselves on being tiresomely ignorant and
foolish sneer at as &ldquo;blue-stockings&rdquo;; that is to say,
possessing brains, she had felt the necessity of using
them.&nbsp; Solomon Appleyard, widower, a sensible old gentleman,
prospering in the printing business, and seeing no necessity for
a woman regarding herself as nothing but a doll, a somewhat
uninteresting plaything the newness once worn off, thankfully
encouraged her.&nbsp; Miss Appleyard had returned from Girton
wise in many things, but not in knowledge of the world, which
knowledge, too early acquired, does not always make for good in
young man or woman.&nbsp; A serious little virgin, Miss
Appleyard&rsquo;s ambition was to help the human race.&nbsp; What
more useful work could have come to her hand than the raising of
this poor but intelligent young grocer&rsquo;s assistant unto the
knowledge and the love of higher things.&nbsp; That Grindley
junior happened to be an exceedingly good-looking and charming
young grocer&rsquo;s assistant had nothing to do with the matter,
so Miss Appleyard would have informed you.&nbsp; In her own
reasoning she was convinced that her interest in him would have
been the same had he been the least attractive of his sex.&nbsp;
That there could be danger in such relationship never occurred to
her.</p>
<p>Miss Appleyard, a convinced Radical, could not conceive the
possibility of a grocer&rsquo;s assistant regarding the daughter
of a well-to-do printer in any other light than that of a
graciously condescending patron.&nbsp; That there could be danger
to herself! you would have been sorry you had suggested the
idea.&nbsp; The expression of lofty scorn would have made you
feel yourself contemptible.</p>
<p>Miss Appleyard&rsquo;s judgment of mankind was justified; no
more promising pupil could have been selected.&nbsp; It was
really marvellous the progress made by Grindley junior, under the
tutelage of Helvetia Appleyard.&nbsp; His earnestness, his
enthusiasm, it quite touched the heart of Helvetia
Appleyard.&nbsp; There were many points, it is true, that puzzled
Grindley junior.&nbsp; Each time the list of them grew
longer.&nbsp; But when Helvetia Appleyard explained them, all
became clear.&nbsp; She marvelled herself at her own wisdom, that
in a moment made darkness luminous to this young man; his rapt
attention while she talked, it was most encouraging.&nbsp; The
boy must surely be a genius.&nbsp; To think that but for her
intuition he might have remained wasted in a grocer&rsquo;s
shop!&nbsp; To rescue such a gem from oblivion, to polish it, was
surely the duty of a conscientious Hypatia.&nbsp; Two
visits&mdash;three visits a week to the little shop in Rolls
Court were quite inadequate, so many passages there were
requiring elucidation.&nbsp; London in early morning became their
classroom: the great, wide, empty, silent streets; the
mist-curtained parks, the silence broken only by the
blackbirds&rsquo; amorous whistle, the thrushes&rsquo; invitation
to delight; the old gardens, hidden behind narrow ways.&nbsp;
Nathaniel George and Janet Helvetia would rest upon a seat, no
living creature within sight, save perhaps a passing policeman or
some dissipated cat.&nbsp; Janet Helvetia would expound.&nbsp;
Nathaniel George, his fine eyes fixed on hers, seemed never to
tire of drinking in her wisdom.</p>
<p>There were times when Janet Helvetia, to reassure herself as
to the maidenly correctness of her behaviour, had to recall quite
forcibly the fact that she was the daughter of Solomon Appleyard,
owner of the big printing establishment; and he a simple
grocer.&nbsp; One day, raised a little in the social scale,
thanks to her, Nathaniel George would marry someone in his own
rank of life.&nbsp; Reflecting upon the future of Nathaniel
George, Janet Helvetia could not escape a shade of sadness.&nbsp;
It was difficult to imagine precisely the wife she would have
chosen for Nathaniel George.&nbsp; She hoped he would do nothing
foolish.&nbsp; Rising young men so often marry wives that hamper
rather than help them.</p>
<p>One Sunday morning in late autumn, they walked and talked in
the shady garden of Lincoln&rsquo;s Inn.&nbsp; Greek they thought
it was they had been talking; as a matter of fact, a much older
language.&nbsp; A young gardener was watering flowers, and as
they passed him he grinned.&nbsp; It was not an offensive grin,
rather a sympathetic grin; but Miss Appleyard didn&rsquo;t like
being grinned at.&nbsp; What was there to grin at?&nbsp; Her
personal appearance? some <i>gaucherie</i> in her dress?&nbsp;
Impossible.&nbsp; No lady in all St. Dunstan was ever more
precise.&nbsp; She glanced at her companion: a clean-looking,
well-groomed, well-dressed youth.&nbsp; Suddenly it occurred to
Miss Appleyard that she and Grindley junior were holding each
other&rsquo;s hand.&nbsp; Miss Appleyard was justly
indignant.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How dare you!&rdquo; said Miss Appleyard.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I am exceedingly angry with you.&nbsp; How dare
you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The olive skin was scarlet.&nbsp; There were tears in the
hazel eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Leave me this minute!&rdquo; commanded Miss
Appleyard.</p>
<p>Instead of which, Grindley junior seized both her hands.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I love you!&nbsp; I adore you!&nbsp; I worship
you!&rdquo; poured forth young Grindley, forgetful of all Miss
Appleyard had ever told him concerning the folly of
tautology.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You had no right,&rdquo; said Miss Appleyard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t help it,&rdquo; pleaded young
Grindley.&nbsp; &ldquo;And that isn&rsquo;t the worst.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Miss Appleyard paled visibly.&nbsp; For a grocer&rsquo;s
assistant to dare to fall in love with her, especially after all
the trouble she had taken with him!&nbsp; What could be
worse?</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not a grocer,&rdquo; continued young
Grindley, deeply conscious of crime.&nbsp; &ldquo;I mean, not a
real grocer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And Grindley junior then and there made a clean breast of the
whole sad, terrible tale of shameless deceit, practised by the
greatest villain the world had ever produced, upon the noblest
and most beautiful maiden that ever turned grim London town into
a fairy city of enchanted ways.</p>
<p>Not at first could Miss Appleyard entirely grasp it; not till
hours later, when she sat alone in her own room, where,
fortunately for himself, Grindley junior was not, did the whole
force and meaning of the thing come home to her.&nbsp; It was a
large room, taking up half of the top story of the big Georgian
house in Nevill&rsquo;s Court; but even as it was, Miss Appleyard
felt cramped.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For a year&mdash;for nearly a whole year,&rdquo; said
Miss Appleyard, addressing the bust of William Shakespeare,
&ldquo;have I been slaving my life out, teaching him elementary
Latin and the first five books of Euclid!&rdquo;</p>
<p>As it has been remarked, it was fortunate for Grindley junior
he was out of reach.&nbsp; The bust of William Shakespeare
maintained its irritating aspect of benign philosophy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose I should,&rdquo; mused Miss Appleyard,
&ldquo;if he had told me at first&mdash;as he ought to have told
me&mdash;of course I should naturally have had nothing more to do
with him.&nbsp; I suppose,&rdquo; mused Miss Appleyard, &ldquo;a
man in love, if he is really in love, doesn&rsquo;t quite know
what he&rsquo;s doing.&nbsp; I suppose one ought to make
allowances.&nbsp; But, oh! when I think of it&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>And then Grindley junior&rsquo;s guardian angel must surely
have slipped into the room, for Miss Appleyard, irritated beyond
endurance at the philosophical indifference of the bust of
William Shakespeare, turned away from it, and as she did so,
caught sight of herself in the looking-glass.&nbsp; Miss
Appleyard approached the glass a little nearer.&nbsp; A
woman&rsquo;s hair is never quite as it should be.&nbsp; Miss
Appleyard, standing before the glass, began, she knew not why, to
find reasons excusing Grindley junior.&nbsp; After all, was not
forgiveness an excellent thing in woman?&nbsp; None of us are
quite perfect.&nbsp; The guardian angel of Grindley junior seized
the opportunity.</p>
<p>That evening Solomon Appleyard sat upright in his chair,
feeling confused.&nbsp; So far as he could understand it, a
certain young man, a grocer&rsquo;s assistant, but not a
grocer&rsquo;s assistant&mdash;but that, of course, was not his
fault, his father being an old brute&mdash;had behaved most
abominably; but not, on reflection, as badly as he might have
done, and had acted on the whole very honourably, taking into
consideration the fact that one supposed he could hardly help
it.&nbsp; Helvetia was, of course, very indignant with him, but
on the other hand, did not quite see what else she could have
done, she being not at all sure whether she really cared for him
or whether she didn&rsquo;t; that everything had been quite
proper and would not have happened if she had known it; that
everything was her fault, except most things, which
weren&rsquo;t; but that of the two she blamed herself entirely,
seeing that she could not have guessed anything of the
kind.&nbsp; And did he, Solomon Appleyard, think that she ought
to be very angry and never marry anybody else, or was she
justified in overlooking it and engaging herself to the only man
she felt she could ever love?</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mustn&rsquo;t think, Dad, that I meant to deceive
you.&nbsp; I should have told you at the beginning&mdash;you know
I would&mdash;if it hadn&rsquo;t all happened so
suddenly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let me see,&rdquo; said Solomon Appleyard, &ldquo;did
you tell me his name, or didn&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nathaniel,&rdquo; said Miss Appleyard.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t I mention it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t happen to know his surname, do you,&rdquo;
inquired her father.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Grindley,&rdquo; explained Miss
Appleyard&mdash;&ldquo;the son of Grindley, the Sauce
man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Miss Appleyard experienced one of the surprises of her
life.&nbsp; Never before to her recollection had her father
thwarted a single wish of her life.&nbsp; A widower for the last
twelve years, his chief delight had been to humour her.&nbsp; His
voice, as he passionately swore that never with his consent
should his daughter marry the son of Hezekiah Grindley, sounded
strange to her.&nbsp; Pleadings, even tears, for the first time
in her life proved fruitless.</p>
<p>Here was a pretty kettle of fish!&nbsp; That Grindley junior
should defy his own parent, risk possibly the loss of his
inheritance, had seemed to both a not improper proceeding.&nbsp;
When Nathaniel George had said with fine enthusiasm: &ldquo;Let
him keep his money if he will; I&rsquo;ll make my own way; there
isn&rsquo;t enough money in the world to pay for losing
you!&rdquo;&nbsp; Janet Helvetia, though she had expressed
disapproval of such unfilial attitude, had in secret
sympathised.&nbsp; But for her to disregard the wishes of her own
doting father was not to be thought of.&nbsp; What was to be
done?</p>
<p>Perhaps one Peter Hope, residing in Gough Square hard by,
might help young folks in sore dilemma with wise counsel.&nbsp;
Peter Hope, editor and part proprietor of <i>Good Humour</i>, one
penny weekly, was much esteemed by Solomon Appleyard, printer and
publisher of aforesaid paper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A good fellow, old Hope,&rdquo; Solomon would often
impress upon his managing clerk.&nbsp; &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry
him more than you can help; things will improve.&nbsp; We can
trust him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Peter Hope sat at his desk, facing Miss Appleyard.&nbsp;
Grindley junior sat on the cushioned seat beneath the middle
window.&nbsp; <i>Good Humour&rsquo;s</i> sub-editor stood before
the fire, her hands behind her back.</p>
<p>The case appeared to Peter Hope to be one of exceeding
difficulty.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; explained Miss Appleyard, &ldquo;I
shall never marry without my father&rsquo;s consent.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Peter Hope thought the resolution most proper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;On the other hand,&rdquo; continued Miss Appleyard,
&ldquo;nothing shall induce me to marry a man I do not
love.&rdquo;&nbsp; Miss Appleyard thought the probabilities were
that she would end by becoming a female missionary.</p>
<p>Peter Hope&rsquo;s experience had led him to the conclusion
that young people sometimes changed their mind.</p>
<p>The opinion of the House, clearly though silently expressed,
was that Peter Hope&rsquo;s experience, as regarded this
particular case, counted for nothing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall go straight to the Governor,&rdquo; explained
Grindley junior, &ldquo;and tell him that I consider myself
engaged for life to Miss Appleyard.&nbsp; I know what will
happen&mdash;I know the sort of idea he has got into his
head.&nbsp; He will disown me, and I shall go off to
Africa.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Peter Hope was unable to see how Grindley junior&rsquo;s
disappearance into the wilds of Africa was going to assist the
matter under discussion.</p>
<p>Grindley junior&rsquo;s view was that the wilds of Africa
would afford a fitting background to the passing away of a
blighted existence.</p>
<p>Peter Hope had a suspicion that Grindley junior had for the
moment parted company with that sweet reasonableness that
otherwise, so Peter Hope felt sure, was Grindley junior&rsquo;s
guiding star.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I mean it, sir,&rdquo; reasserted Grindley
junior.&nbsp; &ldquo;I am&mdash;&rdquo; Grindley junior was about
to add &ldquo;well educated&rdquo;; but divining that education
was a topic not pleasing at the moment to the ears of Helvetia
Appleyard, had tact enough to substitute &ldquo;not a fool.&nbsp;
I can earn my own living; and I should like to get
away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It seems to me&mdash;&rdquo; said the sub-editor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, Tommy&mdash;I mean Jane,&rdquo; warned her Peter
Hope.&nbsp; He always called her Jane in company, unless he was
excited.&nbsp; &ldquo;I know what you are going to say.&nbsp; I
won&rsquo;t have it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was only going to say&mdash;&rdquo; urged the
sub-editor in tone of one suffering injustice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I quite know what you were going to say,&rdquo;
retorted Peter hotly.&nbsp; &ldquo;I can see it by your
chin.&nbsp; You are going to take their part&mdash;and suggest
their acting undutifully towards their parents.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wasn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; returned the sub-editor.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I was only&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You were,&rdquo; persisted Peter.&nbsp; &ldquo;I ought
not to have allowed you to be present.&nbsp; I might have known
you would interfere.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&mdash;going to say we are in want of some help in the
office.&nbsp; You know we are.&nbsp; And that if Mr. Grindley
would be content with a small salary&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Small salary be hanged!&rdquo; snarled Peter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&mdash;there would be no need for his going to
Africa.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And how would that help us?&rdquo; demanded
Peter.&nbsp; &ldquo;Even if the boy were so&mdash;so headstrong,
so unfilial as to defy his father, who has worked for him all
these years, how would that remove the obstacle of Mr.
Appleyard&rsquo;s refusal?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, don&rsquo;t you see&mdash;&rdquo; explained the
sub-editor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; snapped Peter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If, on his declaring to his father that nothing will
ever induce him to marry any other woman but Miss Appleyard, his
father disowns him, as he thinks it likely&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A dead cert!&rdquo; was Grindley junior&rsquo;s
conviction.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well; he is no longer old Grindley&rsquo;s son,
and what possible objection can Mr. Appleyard have to him
then?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Peter Hope arose and expounded at length and in suitable
language the folly and uselessness of the scheme.</p>
<p>But what chance had ever the wisdom of Age against the
enthusiasm of Youth, reaching for its object.&nbsp; Poor Peter,
expostulating, was swept into the conspiracy.&nbsp; Grindley
junior the next morning stood before his father in the private
office in High Holborn.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am sorry, sir,&rdquo; said Grindley junior, &ldquo;if
I have proved a disappointment to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Damn your sympathy!&rdquo; said Grindley senior.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Keep it till you are asked for it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope we part friends, sir,&rdquo; said Grindley
junior, holding out his hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why do you irate me?&rdquo; asked Grindley
senior.&nbsp; &ldquo;I have thought of nothing but you these
five-and-twenty years.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t, sir,&rdquo; answered Grindley
junior.&nbsp; &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t say I love you.&nbsp; It did
not seem to me you&mdash;you wanted it.&nbsp; But I like you,
sir, and I respect you.&nbsp; And&mdash;and I&rsquo;m sorry to
have to hurt you, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you are determined to give up all your prospects,
all the money, for the sake of this&mdash;this girl?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t seem like giving up anything,
sir,&rdquo; replied Grindley junior, simply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t so much as I thought it was going to
be,&rdquo; said the old man, after a pause.&nbsp; &ldquo;Perhaps
it is for the best.&nbsp; I might have been more obstinate if
things had been going all right.&nbsp; The Lord has chastened
me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t the business doing well, Dad?&rdquo; asked
the young man, with sorrow in his voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s it got to do with you?&rdquo; snapped his
father.&nbsp; &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve cut yourself adrift from
it.&nbsp; You leave me now I am going down.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Grindley junior, not knowing what to say, put his arms round
the little old man.</p>
<p>And in this way Tommy&rsquo;s brilliant scheme fell through
and came to naught.&nbsp; Instead, old Grindley visited once
again the big house in Nevill&rsquo;s Court, and remained long
closeted with old Solomon in the office on the second
floor.&nbsp; It was late in the evening when Solomon opened the
door and called upstairs to Janet Helvetia to come down.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I used to know you long ago,&rdquo; said Hezekiah
Grindley, rising.&nbsp; &ldquo;You were quite a little girl
then.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Later, the troublesome Sauce disappeared entirely, cut out by
newer flavours.&nbsp; Grindley junior studied the printing
business.&nbsp; It almost seemed as if old Appleyard had been
waiting but for this.&nbsp; Some six months later they found him
dead in his counting-house.&nbsp; Grindley junior became the
printer and publisher of <i>Good Humour</i>.</p>
<h2>STORY THE FOURTH&mdash;Miss Ramsbotham gives her
Services</h2>
<p>To regard Miss Ramsbotham as a marriageable quantity would
have occurred to few men.&nbsp; Endowed by Nature with every
feminine quality calculated to inspire liking, she had, on the
other hand, been disinherited of every attribute calculated to
excite passion.&nbsp; An ugly woman has for some men an
attraction; the proof is ever present to our eyes.&nbsp; Miss
Ramsbotham was plain but pleasant looking.&nbsp; Large, healthy
in mind and body, capable, self-reliant, and cheerful, blessed
with a happy disposition together with a keen sense of humour,
there was about her absolutely nothing for tenderness to lay hold
of.&nbsp; An ideal wife, she was an impossible sweetheart.&nbsp;
Every man was her friend.&nbsp; The suggestion that any man could
be her lover she herself would have greeted with a clear, ringing
laugh.</p>
<p>Not that she held love in despite; for such folly she was
possessed of far too much sound sense.&nbsp; &ldquo;To have
somebody in love with you&mdash;somebody strong and good,&rdquo;
so she would confess to her few close intimates, a dreamy
expression clouding for an instant her broad, sunny face,
&ldquo;why, it must be just lovely!&rdquo;&nbsp; For Miss
Ramsbotham was prone to American phraseology, and had even been
at some pains, during a six months&rsquo; journey through the
States (whither she had been commissioned by a conscientious
trade journal seeking reliable information concerning the
condition of female textile workers) to acquire a slight but
decided American accent.&nbsp; It was her one affectation, but
assumed, as one might feel certain, for a practical and
legitimate object.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can have no conception,&rdquo; she would explain,
laughing, &ldquo;what a help I find it.&nbsp; &lsquo;I&rsquo;m
&lsquo;Muriken&rsquo; is the &lsquo;Civis Romanus sum&rsquo; of
the modern woman&rsquo;s world.&nbsp; It opens every door to
us.&nbsp; If I ring the bell and say, &lsquo;Oh, if you please, I
have come to interview Mr. So-and-So for such-and-such a
paper,&rsquo; the footman looks through me at the opposite side
of the street, and tells me to wait in the hall while he inquires
if Mr. So-and-So will see me or not.&nbsp; But if I say,
&lsquo;That&rsquo;s my keerd, young man.&nbsp; You tell your
master Miss Ramsbotham is waiting for him in the showroom, and
will take it real kind if he&rsquo;ll just bustle himself,&rsquo;
the poor fellow walks backwards till he stumbles against the
bottom stair, and my gentleman comes down with profuse apologies
for having kept me waiting three minutes and a half.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;And to be in love with someone,&rdquo; she would
continue, &ldquo;someone great that one could look up to and
honour and worship&mdash;someone that would fill one&rsquo;s
whole life, make it beautiful, make every day worth living, I
think that would be better still.&nbsp; To work merely for
one&rsquo;s self, to think merely for one&rsquo;s self, it is so
much less interesting.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then, at some such point of the argument, Miss Ramsbotham
would jump up from her chair and shake herself indignantly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, what nonsense I&rsquo;m talking,&rdquo; she would
tell herself, and her listeners.&nbsp; &ldquo;I make a very fair
income, have a host of friends, and enjoy every hour of my
life.&nbsp; I should like to have been pretty or handsome, of
course; but no one can have all the good things of this world,
and I have my brains.&nbsp; At one time, perhaps, yes; but
now&mdash;no, honestly I would not change myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Miss Ramsbotham was sorry that no man had ever fallen in love
with her, but that she could understand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is quite clear to me.&rdquo;&nbsp; So she had once
unburdened herself to her bosom friend.&nbsp; &ldquo;Man for the
purposes of the race has been given two kinds of love, between
which, according to his opportunities and temperament, he is free
to choose: he can fall down upon his knees and adore physical
beauty (for Nature ignores entirely our mental side), or he can
take delight in circling with his protecting arm the weak and
helpless.&nbsp; Now, I make no appeal to either instinct.&nbsp; I
possess neither the charm nor beauty to attract&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Beauty,&rdquo; reminded her the bosom friend,
consolingly, &ldquo;dwells in the beholder&rsquo;s
eye.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear,&rdquo; cheerfully replied Miss Ramsbotham,
&ldquo;it would have to be an eye of the range and capacity Sam
Weller frankly owned up to not possessing&mdash;a patent
double-million magnifying, capable of seeing through a deal board
and round the corner sort of eye&mdash;to detect any beauty in
me.&nbsp; And I am much too big and sensible for any man not a
fool ever to think of wanting to take care of me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I believe,&rdquo; remembered Miss Ramsbotham, &ldquo;if
it does not sound like idle boasting, I might have had a husband,
of a kind, if Fate had not compelled me to save his life.&nbsp; I
met him one year at Huyst, a small, quiet watering-place on the
Dutch coast.&nbsp; He would walk always half a step behind me,
regarding me out of the corner of his eye quite approvingly at
times.&nbsp; He was a widower&mdash;a good little man, devoted to
his three charming children.&nbsp; They took an immense fancy to
me, and I really think I could have got on with him.&nbsp; I am
very adaptable, as you know.&nbsp; But it was not to be.&nbsp; He
got out of his depth one morning, and unfortunately there was no
one within distance but myself who could swim.&nbsp; I knew what
the result would be.&nbsp; You remember Labiche&rsquo;s comedy,
<i>Les Voyage de Monsieur Perrichon</i>?&nbsp; Of course, every
man hates having had his life saved, after it is over; and you
can imagine how he must hate having it saved by a woman.&nbsp;
But what was I to do?&nbsp; In either case he would be lost to
me, whether I let him drown or whether I rescued him.&nbsp; So,
as it really made no difference, I rescued him.&nbsp; He was very
grateful, and left the next morning.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is my destiny.&nbsp; No man has ever fallen in love
with me, and no man ever will.&nbsp; I used to worry myself about
it when I was younger.&nbsp; As a child I hugged to my bosom for
years an observation I had overheard an aunt of mine whisper to
my mother one afternoon as they sat knitting and talking, not
thinking I was listening.&nbsp; &lsquo;You never can tell,&rsquo;
murmured my aunt, keeping her eyes carefully fixed upon her
needles; &lsquo;children change so.&nbsp; I have known the
plainest girls grow up into quite beautiful women.&nbsp; I should
not worry about it if I were you&mdash;not yet
awhile.&rsquo;&nbsp; My mother was not at all a bad-looking
woman, and my father was decidedly handsome; so there seemed no
reason why I should not hope.&nbsp; I pictured myself the ugly
duckling of Andersen&rsquo;s fairy-tale, and every morning on
waking I would run straight to my glass and try to persuade
myself that the feathers of the swan were beginning at last to
show themselves.&rdquo;&nbsp; Miss Ramsbotham laughed, a genuine
laugh of amusement, for of self-pity not a trace was now
remaining to her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Later I plucked hope again,&rdquo; continued Miss
Ramsbotham her confession, &ldquo;from the reading of a certain
school of fiction more popular twenty years ago than now.&nbsp;
In these romances the heroine was never what you would call
beautiful, unless in common with the hero you happened to possess
exceptional powers of observation.&nbsp; But she was better than
that, she was good.&nbsp; I do not regard as time wasted the
hours I spent studying this quaint literature.&nbsp; It helped
me, I am sure, to form habits that have since been of service to
me.&nbsp; I made a point, when any young man visitor happened to
be staying with us, of rising exceptionally early in the morning,
so that I always appeared at the breakfast-table fresh, cheerful,
and carefully dressed, with, when possible, a dew-besprinkled
flower in my hair to prove that I had already been out in the
garden.&nbsp; The effort, as far as the young man visitor was
concerned, was always thrown away; as a general rule, he came
down late himself, and generally too drowsy to notice anything
much.&nbsp; But it was excellent practice for me.&nbsp; I wake
now at seven o&rsquo;clock as a matter of course, whatever time I
go to bed.&nbsp; I made my own dresses and most of our cakes, and
took care to let everybody know it.&nbsp; Though I say it who
should not, I play and sing rather well.&nbsp; I certainly was
never a fool.&nbsp; I had no little brothers and sisters to whom
to be exceptionally devoted, but I had my cousins about the house
as much as possible, and damaged their characters, if anything,
by over-indulgence.&nbsp; My dear, it never caught even a
curate!&nbsp; I am not one of those women to run down men; I
think them delightful creatures, and in a general way I find them
very intelligent.&nbsp; But where their hearts are concerned it
is the girl with the frizzy hair, who wants two people to help
her over the stile, that is their idea of an angel.&nbsp; No man
could fall in love with me; he couldn&rsquo;t if he tried.&nbsp;
That I can understand; but&rdquo;&mdash;Miss Ramsbotham sunk her
voice to a more confidential tone&mdash;&ldquo;what I cannot
understand is that I have never fallen in love with any man,
because I like them all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have given the explanation yourself,&rdquo;
suggested the bosom friend&mdash;one Susan Fossett, the
&ldquo;Aunt Emma&rdquo; of <i>The Ladies&rsquo; Journal</i>, a
nice woman, but talkative.&nbsp; &ldquo;You are too
sensible.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Miss Ramsbotham shook her head, &ldquo;I should just love to
fall in love.&nbsp; When I think about it, I feel quite ashamed
of myself for not having done so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Whether it was this idea, namely, that it was her duty, or
whether it was that passion came to her, unsought, somewhat late
in life, and therefore all the stronger, she herself would
perhaps have been unable to declare.&nbsp; Certain only it is
that at over thirty years of age this clever, sensible,
clear-seeing woman fell to sighing and blushing, starting and
stammering at the sounding of a name, as though for all the world
she had been a love-sick girl in her teens.</p>
<p>Susan Fossett, her bosom friend, brought the strange tidings
to Bohemia one foggy November afternoon, her opportunity being a
tea-party given by Peter Hope to commemorate the birthday of his
adopted daughter and sub-editor, Jane Helen, commonly called
Tommy.&nbsp; The actual date of Tommy&rsquo;s birthday was known
only to the gods; but out of the London mist to wifeless,
childless Peter she had come the evening of a certain November
the eighteenth, and therefore by Peter and his friends November
the eighteenth had been marked upon the calendar as a day on
which they should rejoice together.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is bound to leak out sooner or later,&rdquo; Susan
Fossett was convinced, &ldquo;so I may as well tell you: that
gaby Mary Ramsbotham has got herself engaged.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nonsense!&rdquo; was Peter Hope&rsquo;s involuntary
ejaculation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Precisely what I mean to tell her the very next time I
see her,&rdquo; added Susan.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who to?&rdquo; demanded Tommy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mean &lsquo;to whom.&rsquo;&nbsp; The preeposition
governs the objective case,&rdquo; corrected her James Douglas
McTear, commonly called &ldquo;The Wee Laddie,&rdquo; who himself
wrote English better than he spoke it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I meant &lsquo;to whom,&rsquo;&rdquo; explained
Tommy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ye didna say it,&rdquo; persisted the Wee Laddie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know to whom,&rdquo; replied Miss
Ramsbotham&rsquo;s bosom friend, sipping tea and breathing
indignation.&nbsp; &ldquo;To something idiotic and incongruous
that will make her life a misery to her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Somerville, the briefless, held that in the absence of all
data such conclusion was unjustifiable.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If it had been to anything sensible,&rdquo; was Miss
Fossett&rsquo;s opinion, &ldquo;she would not have kept me in the
dark about it, to spring it upon me like a bombshell.&nbsp;
I&rsquo;ve never had so much as a hint from her until I received
this absurd scrawl an hour ago.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Miss Fossett produced from her bag a letter written in
pencil.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There can be no harm in your hearing it,&rdquo; was
Miss Fossett&rsquo;s excuse; &ldquo;it will give you an idea of
the state of the poor thing&rsquo;s mind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The tea-drinkers left their cups and gathered round her.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Dear Susan,&rdquo; read Miss Fossett, &ldquo;I shall not
be able to be with you to-morrow.&nbsp; Please get me out of it
nicely.&nbsp; I can&rsquo;t remember at the moment what it
is.&nbsp; You&rsquo;ll be surprised to hear that I&rsquo;m
<i>engaged</i>&mdash;to be married, I mean, I can hardly
<i>realise</i> it.&nbsp; I hardly seem to know where I am.&nbsp;
Have just made up my mind to run down to Yorkshire and see
grandmamma.&nbsp; I must do <i>something</i>.&nbsp; I must
<i>talk</i> to <i>somebody</i> and&mdash;forgive me,
dear&mdash;but you <i>are</i> so sensible, and just
now&mdash;well I don&rsquo;t <i>feel</i> sensible.&nbsp; Will
tell you all about it when I see you&mdash;next week,
perhaps.&nbsp; You must <i>try</i> to like him.&nbsp; He is
<i>so</i> handsome and <i>really</i> clever&mdash;in his own
way.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t scold me.&nbsp; I never thought it
possible that <i>anyone</i> could be so happy.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s
quite a different sort of happiness to <i>any</i> other sort of
happiness.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t know how to describe it.&nbsp;
Please ask Burcot to let me off the antequarian congress.&nbsp; I
feel I should do it badly.&nbsp; I am so thankful he has
<i>no</i> relatives&mdash;in England.&nbsp; I should have been so
<i>terribly</i> nervous.&nbsp; Twelve hours ago I could not have
<i>dreamt</i> of it, and now I walk on tiptoe for fear of waking
up.&nbsp; Did I leave my chinchilla at your rooms?&nbsp;
Don&rsquo;t be angry with me.&nbsp; I should have told you if I
had known.&nbsp; In haste.&nbsp; Yours, Mary.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s dated from Marylebone Road, and yesterday
afternoon she did leave her chinchilla in my rooms, which makes
me think it really must be from Mary Ramsbotham.&nbsp; Otherwise
I should have my doubts,&rdquo; added Miss Fossett, as she folded
up the letter and replaced it in her bag.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Id is love!&rdquo; was the explanation of Dr. William
Smith, his round, red face illuminated with poetic ecstasy.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Love has gone to her&mdash;has dransformed her once again
into the leedle maid.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Love,&rdquo; retorted Susan Fossett,
&ldquo;doesn&rsquo;t transform an intelligent, educated woman
into a person who writes a letter all in jerks, underlines every
other word, spells antiquarian with an &rsquo;e,&rsquo; and
Burcott&rsquo;s name, whom she has known for the last eight
years, with only one &rsquo;t.&rsquo;&nbsp; The woman has gone
stark, staring mad!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We must wait until we have seen him,&rdquo; was
Peter&rsquo;s judicious view.&nbsp; &ldquo;I should be so glad to
think that the dear lady was happy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So should I,&rdquo; added Miss Fossett drily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One of the most sensible women I have ever met,&rdquo;
commented William Clodd.&nbsp; &ldquo;Lucky man, whoever he
is.&nbsp; Half wish I&rsquo;d thought of it myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am not saying that he isn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; retorted
Miss Fossett.&nbsp; &ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t him I&rsquo;m worrying
about.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I preesume you mean &lsquo;he,&rsquo;&rdquo; suggested
the Wee Laddie.&nbsp; &ldquo;The verb &lsquo;to
be&rsquo;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For goodness&rsquo; sake,&rdquo; suggested Miss Fossett
to Tommy, &ldquo;give that man something to eat or drink.&nbsp;
That&rsquo;s the worst of people who take up grammar late in
life.&nbsp; Like all converts, they become fanatical.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s a ripping good sort, is Mary
Ramsbotham,&rdquo; exclaimed Grindley junior, printer and
publisher of <i>Good Humour</i>.&nbsp; &ldquo;The marvel to me is
that no man hitherto has ever had the sense to want
her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, you men!&rdquo; cried Miss Fossett.&nbsp; &ldquo;A
pretty face and an empty head is all you want.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Must they always go together?&rdquo; laughed Mrs.
Grindley junior, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Helvetia Appleyard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Exceptions prove the rule,&rdquo; grunted Miss
Fossett.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What a happy saying that is,&rdquo; smiled Mrs.
Grindley junior.&nbsp; &ldquo;I wonder sometimes how conversation
was ever carried on before it was invented.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;De man who would fall in love wid our dear frent
Mary,&rdquo; thought Dr. Smith, &ldquo;he must be quite
egsceptional.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You needn&rsquo;t talk about her as if she was a
monster&mdash;I mean were,&rdquo; corrected herself Miss Fossett,
with a hasty glance towards the Wee Laddie.&nbsp; &ldquo;There
isn&rsquo;t a man I know that&rsquo;s worthy of her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I mean,&rdquo; explained the doctor, &ldquo;dat he must
be a man of character&mdash;of brain.&nbsp; Id is de noble man
dat is attracted by de noble woman.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;By the chorus-girl more often,&rdquo; suggested Miss
Fossett.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We must hope for the best,&rdquo; counselled
Peter.&nbsp; &ldquo;I cannot believe that a clever, capable woman
like Mary Ramsbotham would make a fool of herself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;From what I have seen,&rdquo; replied Miss Fossett,
&ldquo;it&rsquo;s just the clever people&mdash;as regards this
particular matter&mdash;who do make fools of
themselves.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Unfortunately Miss Fossett&rsquo;s judgment proved to be
correct.&nbsp; On being introduced a fortnight later to Miss
Ramsbotham&rsquo;s fianc&eacute;, the impulse of Bohemia was to
exclaim, &ldquo;Great Scott!&nbsp; Whatever in the name
of&mdash;&rdquo;&nbsp; Then on catching sight of Miss
Ramsbotham&rsquo;s transfigured face and trembling hands Bohemia
recollected itself in time to murmur instead: &ldquo;Delighted,
I&rsquo;m sure!&rdquo; and to offer mechanical
congratulations.&nbsp; Reginald Peters was a pretty but
remarkably foolish-looking lad of about two-and-twenty, with
curly hair and receding chin; but to Miss Ramsbotham evidently a
promising Apollo.&nbsp; Her first meeting with him had taken
place at one of the many political debating societies then in
fashion, attendance at which Miss Ramsbotham found useful for
purposes of journalistic &ldquo;copy.&rdquo;&nbsp; Miss
Ramsbotham, hitherto a Radical of pronounced views, he had
succeeded under three months in converting into a strong
supporter of the Gentlemanly Party.&nbsp; His feeble political
platitudes, which a little while before she would have seized
upon merrily to ridicule, she now sat drinking in, her plain face
suffused with admiration.&nbsp; Away from him and in connection
with those subjects&mdash;somewhat numerous&mdash;about which he
knew little and cared less, she retained her sense and humour;
but in his presence she remained comparatively speechless, gazing
up into his somewhat watery eyes with the grateful expression of
one learning wisdom from a master.</p>
<p>Her absurd adoration&mdash;irritating beyond measure to her
friends, and which even to her lover, had he possessed a grain of
sense, would have appeared ridiculous&mdash;to Master Peters was
evidently a gratification.&nbsp; Of selfish, exacting nature, he
must have found the services of this brilliant woman of the world
of much practical advantage.&nbsp; Knowing all the most
interesting people in London, it was her pride and pleasure to
introduce him everywhere.&nbsp; Her friends put up with him for
her sake; to please her made him welcome, did their best to like
him, and disguised their failure.&nbsp; The free entry to a
places of amusement saved his limited purse.&nbsp; Her influence,
he had instinct enough to perceive, could not fail to be of use
to him in his profession: that of a barrister.&nbsp; She praised
him to prominent solicitors, took him to tea with judges&rsquo;
wives, interested examiners on his behalf.&nbsp; In return he
overlooked her many disadvantages, and did not fail to let her
know it.&nbsp; Miss Ramsbotham&rsquo;s gratitude was
boundless.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do so wish I were younger and better looking,&rdquo;
she sighed to the bosom friend.&nbsp; &ldquo;For myself, I
don&rsquo;t mind; I have got used to it.&nbsp; But it is so hard
on Reggie.&nbsp; He feels it, I know he does, though he never
openly complains.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He would be a cad if he did,&rdquo; answered Susan
Fossett, who having tried conscientiously for a month to tolerate
the fellow, had in the end declared her inability even to do more
than avoid open expression of cordial dislike.&nbsp; &ldquo;Added
to which I don&rsquo;t quite see of what use it would be.&nbsp;
You never told him you were young and pretty, did you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I told him, my dear,&rdquo; replied Miss Ramsbotham,
&ldquo;the actual truth.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t want to take any
credit for doing so; it seemed the best course.&nbsp; You see,
unfortunately, I look my age.&nbsp; With most men it would have
made a difference.&nbsp; You have no idea how good he is.&nbsp;
He assured me he had engaged himself to me with his eyes open,
and that there was no need to dwell upon unpleasant topics.&nbsp;
It is so wonderful to me that he should care for me&mdash;he who
could have half the women in London at his feet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, he&rsquo;s the type that would attract them, I
daresay,&rdquo; agreed Susan Fossett.&nbsp; &ldquo;But are you
quite sure that he does?&mdash;care for you, I mean.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear,&rdquo; returned Miss Ramsbotham, &ldquo;you
remember Rochefoucauld&rsquo;s definition.&nbsp; &lsquo;One
loves, the other consents to be loved.&rsquo;&nbsp; If he will
only let me do that I shall be content.&nbsp; It is more than I
had any right to expect.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, you are a fool,&rdquo; told her bluntly her bosom
friend.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know I am,&rdquo; admitted Miss Ramsbotham;
&ldquo;but I had no idea that being a fool was so
delightful.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bohemia grew day by day more indignant and amazed.&nbsp; Young
Peters was not even a gentleman.&nbsp; All the little offices of
courtship he left to her.&nbsp; It was she who helped him on with
his coat, and afterwards adjusted her own cloak; she who carried
the parcel, she who followed into and out of the
restaurant.&nbsp; Only when he thought anyone was watching would
he make any attempt to behave to her with even ordinary
courtesy.&nbsp; He bullied her, contradicted her in public,
ignored her openly.&nbsp; Bohemia fumed with impotent rage, yet
was bound to confess that so far as Miss Ramsbotham herself was
concerned he had done more to make her happy than had ever all
Bohemia put together.&nbsp; A tender light took up its dwelling
in her eyes, which for the first time it was noticed were
singularly deep and expressive.&nbsp; The blood, of which she
possessed if anything too much, now came and went, so that her
cheeks, in place of their insistent red, took on a varied pink
and white.&nbsp; Life had entered her thick dark hair, giving to
it shade and shadow.</p>
<p>The woman began to grow younger.&nbsp; She put on flesh.&nbsp;
Sex, hitherto dormant, began to show itself; femininities peeped
out.&nbsp; New tones, suggesting possibilities, crept into her
voice.&nbsp; Bohemia congratulated itself that the affair, after
all, might turn out well.</p>
<p>Then Master Peters spoiled everything by showing a better side
to his nature, and, careless of all worldly considerations,
falling in love himself, honestly, with a girl at the bun
shop.&nbsp; He did the best thing under the circumstances that he
could have done: told Miss Ramsbotham the plain truth, and left
the decision in her hands.</p>
<p>Miss Ramsbotham acted as anyone who knew her would have
foretold.&nbsp; Possibly, in the silence of her delightful little
four-roomed flat over the tailor&rsquo;s shop in Marylebone Road,
her sober, worthy maid dismissed for a holiday, she may have shed
some tears; but, if so, no trace of them was allowed to mar the
peace of mind of Mr. Peters.&nbsp; She merely thanked him for
being frank with her, and by a little present pain saving them
both a future of disaster.&nbsp; It was quite understandable; she
knew he had never really been in love with her.&nbsp; She had
thought him the type of man that never does fall in love, as the
word is generally understood&mdash;Miss Ramsbotham did not add,
with anyone except himself&mdash;and had that been the case, and
he content merely to be loved, they might have been happy
together.&nbsp; As it was&mdash;well, it was fortunate he had
found out the truth before it was too late.&nbsp; Now, would he
take her advice?</p>
<p>Mr. Peters was genuinely grateful, as well he might be, and
would consent to any suggestion that Miss Ramsbotham might make;
felt he had behaved shabbily, was very much ashamed of himself,
would be guided in all things by Miss Ramsbotham, whom he should
always regard as the truest of friends, and so on.</p>
<p>Miss Ramsbotham&rsquo;s suggestion was this: Mr. Peters, no
more robust of body than of mind, had been speaking for some time
past of travel.&nbsp; Having nothing to do now but to wait for
briefs, why not take this opportunity of visiting his only
well-to-do relative, a Canadian farmer.&nbsp; Meanwhile, let Miss
Peggy leave the bun shop and take up her residence in Miss
Ramsbotham&rsquo;s flat.&nbsp; Let there be no
engagement&mdash;merely an understanding.&nbsp; The girl was
pretty, charming, good, Miss Ramsbotham felt sure;
but&mdash;well, a little education, a little training in manners
and behaviour would not be amiss, would it?&nbsp; If, on
returning at the end of six months or a year, Mr. Peters was
still of the same mind, and Peggy also wishful, the affair would
be easier, would it not?</p>
<p>There followed further expressions of eternal gratitude.&nbsp;
Miss Ramsbotham swept all such aside.&nbsp; It would be pleasant
to have a bright young girl to live with her; teaching, moulding
such an one would be a pleasant occupation.</p>
<p>And thus it came to pass that Mr. Reginald Peters disappeared
for a while from Bohemia, to the regret of but few, and there
entered into it one Peggy Nutcombe, as pretty a child as ever
gladdened the eye of man.&nbsp; She had wavy, flaxen hair, a
complexion that might have been manufactured from the essence of
wild roses, the nose that Tennyson bestows upon his
miller&rsquo;s daughter, and a mouth worthy of the Lowther Arcade
in its days of glory.&nbsp; Add to this the quick grace of a
kitten, with the appealing helplessness of a baby in its first
short frock, and you will be able to forgive Mr. Reginald Peters
his faithlessness.&nbsp; Bohemia looked from one to the
other&mdash;from the fairy to the woman&mdash;and ceased to
blame.&nbsp; That the fairy was as stupid as a camel, as selfish
as a pig, and as lazy as a nigger Bohemia did not know;
nor&mdash;so long as her figure and complexion remained what it
was&mdash;would its judgment have been influenced, even if it
had.&nbsp; I speak of the Bohemian male.</p>
<p>But that is just what her figure and complexion did not
do.&nbsp; Mr. Reginald Peters, finding his uncle old, feeble, and
inclined to be fond, deemed it to his advantage to stay longer
than he had intended.&nbsp; Twelve months went by.&nbsp; Miss
Peggy was losing her kittenish grace, was becoming lumpy.&nbsp; A
couple of pimples&mdash;one near the right-hand corner of her
rosebud mouth, and another on the left-hand side of her
tip-tilted nose&mdash;marred her baby face.&nbsp; At the end of
another six months the men called her plump, and the women
fat.&nbsp; Her walk was degenerating into a waddle; stairs caused
her to grunt.&nbsp; She took to breathing with her mouth, and
Bohemia noticed that her teeth were small, badly coloured, and
uneven.&nbsp; The pimples grew in size and number.&nbsp; The
cream and white of her complexion was merging into a general
yellow.&nbsp; A certain greasiness of skin was manifesting
itself.&nbsp; Babyish ways in connection with a woman who must
have weighed about eleven stone struck Bohemia as
incongruous.&nbsp; Her manners, judged alone, had improved.&nbsp;
But they had not improved her.&nbsp; They did not belong to her;
they did not fit her.&nbsp; They sat on her as Sunday broadcloth
on a yokel.&nbsp; She had learned to employ her
&ldquo;h&rsquo;s&rdquo; correctly, and to speak good
grammar.&nbsp; This gave to her conversation a painfully
artificial air.&nbsp; The little learning she had absorbed was
sufficient to bestow upon her an angry consciousness of her own
invincible ignorance.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Miss Ramsbotham had continued upon her course of
rejuvenation.&nbsp; At twenty-nine she had looked thirty-five; at
thirty-two she looked not a day older than five-and-twenty.&nbsp;
Bohemia felt that should she retrograde further at the same rate
she would soon have to shorten her frocks and let down her
hair.&nbsp; A nervous excitability had taken possession of her
that was playing strange freaks not only with her body, but with
her mind.&nbsp; What it gave to the one it seemed to take from
the other.&nbsp; Old friends, accustomed to enjoy with her the
luxury of plain speech, wondered in vain what they had done to
offend her.&nbsp; Her desire was now towards new friends, new
faces.&nbsp; Her sense of humour appeared to be departing from
her; it became unsafe to jest with her.&nbsp; On the other hand,
she showed herself greedy for admiration and flattery.&nbsp; Her
former chums stepped back astonished to watch brainless young
fops making their way with her by complimenting her upon her
blouse, or whispering to her some trite nonsense about her
eyelashes.&nbsp; From her work she took a good percentage of her
brain power to bestow it on her clothes.&nbsp; Of course, she was
successful.&nbsp; Her dresses suited her, showed her to the best
advantage.&nbsp; Beautiful she could never be, and had sense
enough to know it; but a charming, distinguished-looking woman
she had already become.&nbsp; Also, she was on the high road to
becoming a vain, egotistical, commonplace woman.</p>
<p>It was during the process of this, her metamorphosis, that
Peter Hope one evening received a note from her announcing her
intention of visiting him the next morning at the editorial
office of <i>Good Humour</i>.&nbsp; She added in a postscript
that she would prefer the interview to be private.</p>
<p>Punctually to the time appointed Miss Ramsbotham
arrived.&nbsp; Miss Ramsbotham, contrary to her custom, opened
conversation with the weather.&nbsp; Miss Ramsbotham was of
opinion that there was every possibility of rain.&nbsp; Peter
Hope&rsquo;s experience was that there was always possibility of
rain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How is the Paper doing?&rdquo; demanded Miss
Ramsbotham.</p>
<p>The Paper&mdash;for a paper not yet two years old&mdash;was
doing well.&nbsp; &ldquo;We expect very shortly&mdash;very
shortly indeed,&rdquo; explained Peter Hope, &ldquo;to turn the
corner.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah! that &lsquo;corner,&rsquo;&rdquo; sympathised Miss
Ramsbotham.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I confess,&rdquo; smiled Peter Hope, &ldquo;it
doesn&rsquo;t seem to be exactly a right-angled corner.&nbsp; One
reaches it as one thinks.&nbsp; But it takes some getting
round&mdash;what I should describe as a cornery
corner.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What you want,&rdquo; thought Miss Ramsbotham,
&ldquo;are one or two popular features.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Popular features,&rdquo; agreed Peter guardedly,
scenting temptation, &ldquo;are not to be despised, provided one
steers clear of the vulgar and the commonplace.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A Ladies&rsquo; Page!&rdquo; suggested Miss
Ramsbotham&mdash;&ldquo;a page that should make the woman buy
it.&nbsp; The women, believe me, are going to be of more and more
importance to the weekly press.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But why should she want a special page to
herself?&rdquo; demanded Peter Hope.&nbsp; &ldquo;Why should not
the paper as a whole appeal to her?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; was all Miss Ramsbotham could
offer in explanation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We give her literature and the drama, poetry, fiction,
the higher politics, the&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know, I know,&rdquo; interrupted Miss Ramsbotham, who
of late, among other failings new to her, had developed a
tendency towards impatience; &ldquo;but she gets all that in half
a dozen other papers.&nbsp; I have thought it out.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Miss Ramsbotham leaned further across the editorial desk and sunk
her voice unconsciously to a confidential whisper.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Tell her the coming fashions.&nbsp; Discuss the question
whether hat or bonnet makes you look the younger.&nbsp; Tell her
whether red hair or black is to be the new colour, what size
waist is being worn by the best people.&nbsp; Oh, come!&rdquo;
laughed Miss Ramsbotham in answer to Peter&rsquo;s shocked
expression; &ldquo;one cannot reform the world and human nature
all at once.&nbsp; You must appeal to people&rsquo;s folly in
order to get them to listen to your wisdom.&nbsp; Make your paper
a success first.&nbsp; You can make it a power
afterwards.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But,&rdquo; argued Peter, &ldquo;there are already such
papers&mdash;papers devoted to&mdash;to that sort of thing, and
to nothing else.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;At sixpence!&rdquo; replied the practical Miss
Ramsbotham.&nbsp; &ldquo;I am thinking of the lower middle-class
woman who has twenty pounds a year to spend on dress, and who
takes twelve hours a day to think about it, poor creature.&nbsp;
My dear friend, there is a fortune in it.&nbsp; Think of the
advertisements.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Poor Peter groaned&mdash;old Peter, the dreamer of
dreams.&nbsp; But for thought of Tommy! one day to be left alone
to battle with a stony-eyed, deaf world, Peter most assuredly
would have risen in his wrath, would have said to his
distinguished-looking temptress, &ldquo;Get thee behind me, Miss
Ramsbotham.&nbsp; My journalistic instinct whispers to me that
your scheme, judged by the mammon of unrighteousness, is
good.&nbsp; It is a new departure.&nbsp; Ten years hence half the
London journals will have adopted it.&nbsp; There is money in
it.&nbsp; But what of that?&nbsp; Shall I for mere dross sell my
editorial soul, turn the temple of the Mighty Pen into a den
of&mdash;of milliners!&nbsp; Good morning, Miss Ramsbotham.&nbsp;
I grieve for you.&nbsp; I grieve for you as for a fellow-worker
once inspired by devotion to a noble calling, who has fallen from
her high estate.&nbsp; Good morning, madam.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So Peter thought as he sat tattooing with his finger-tips upon
the desk; but only said&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It would have to be well done.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Everything would depend upon how it was done,&rdquo;
agreed Miss Ramsbotham.&nbsp; &ldquo;Badly done, the idea would
be wasted.&nbsp; You would be merely giving it away to some other
paper.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you know of anyone?&rdquo; queried Peter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was thinking of myself,&rdquo; answered Miss
Ramsbotham.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am sorry,&rdquo; said Peter Hope.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo; demanded Miss Ramsbotham.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you think I could do it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think,&rdquo; said Peter, &ldquo;no one could do it
better.&nbsp; I am sorry you should wish to do it&mdash;that is
all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want to do it,&rdquo; replied Miss Ramsbotham, a note
of doggedness in her voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How much do you propose to charge me?&rdquo; Peter
smiled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear lady&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I could not in conscience,&rdquo; explained Miss
Ramsbotham, &ldquo;take payment from both sides.&nbsp; I am going
to make a good deal out of it.&nbsp; I am going to make out of it
at least three hundred a year, and they will be glad to pay
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who will?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The dressmakers.&nbsp; I shall be one of the most
stylish women in London,&rdquo; laughed Miss Ramsbotham.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You used to be a sensible woman,&rdquo; Peter reminded
her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want to live.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t you manage to do it without&mdash;without
being a fool, my dear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; answered Miss Ramsbotham, &ldquo;a woman
can&rsquo;t.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve tried it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; agreed Peter, &ldquo;be it
so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Peter had risen.&nbsp; He laid his shapely, white old hand
upon the woman&rsquo;s shoulder.&nbsp; &ldquo;Tell me when you
want to give it up.&nbsp; I shall be glad.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thus it was arranged.&nbsp; <i>Good Humour</i> gained
circulation and&mdash;of more importance
yet&mdash;advertisements; and Miss Ramsbotham, as she had
predicted, the reputation of being one of the best-dressed women
in London.&nbsp; Her reason for desiring such reputation Peter
Hope had shrewdly guessed.&nbsp; Two months later his suspicions
were confirmed.&nbsp; Mr. Reginald Peters, his uncle being dead,
was on his way back to England.</p>
<p>His return was awaited with impatience only by the occupants
of the little flat in the Marylebone Road; and between these two
the difference of symptom was marked.&nbsp; Mistress Peggy, too
stupid to comprehend the change that had been taking place in
her, looked forward to her lover&rsquo;s arrival with
delight.&nbsp; Mr. Reginald Peters, independently of his
profession, was in consequence of his uncle&rsquo;s death a man
of means.&nbsp; Miss Ramsbotham&rsquo;s tutelage, which had
always been distasteful to her, would now be at an end.&nbsp; She
would be a &ldquo;lady&rdquo; in the true sense of the
word&mdash;according to Miss Peggy&rsquo;s definition, a woman
with nothing to do but eat and drink, and nothing to think of but
dress.&nbsp; Miss Ramsbotham, on the other hand, who might have
anticipated the home-coming of her quondam admirer with hope,
exhibited a strange condition of alarmed misery, which increased
from day to day as the date drew nearer.</p>
<p>The meeting&mdash;whether by design or accident was never
known&mdash;took place at an evening party given by the
proprietors of a new journal.&nbsp; The circumstance was
certainly unfortunate for poor Peggy, whom Bohemia began to
pity.&nbsp; Mr. Peters, knowing both women would be there and so
on the look-out, saw in the distance among the crowd of
notabilities a superbly millinered, tall, graceful woman, whose
face recalled sensations he could not for the moment place.&nbsp;
Chiefly noticeable about her were her exquisite neck and arms,
and the air of perfect breeding with which she moved, talking and
laughing, through the distinguished, fashionable throng.&nbsp;
Beside her strutted, nervously aggressive, a vulgar, fat, pimply,
shapeless young woman, attracting universal attention by the
incongruity of her presence in the room.&nbsp; On being greeted
by the graceful lady of the neck and arms, the conviction forced
itself upon him that this could be no other than the once Miss
Ramsbotham, plain of face and indifferent of dress, whose very
appearance he had almost forgotten.&nbsp; On being greeted
gushingly as &ldquo;Reggie&rdquo; by the sallow-complexioned,
over-dressed young woman he bowed with evident astonishment, and
apologised for a memory that, so he assured the lady, had always
been to him a source of despair.</p>
<p>Of course, he thanked his stars&mdash;and Miss
Ramsbotham&mdash;that the engagement had never been formal.&nbsp;
So far as Mr. Peters was concerned, there was an end to Mistress
Peggy&rsquo;s dream of an existence of everlasting breakfasts in
bed.&nbsp; Leaving the Ramsbotham flat, she returned to the
maternal roof, and there a course of hard work and plain living
tended greatly to improve her figure and complexion; so that in
course of time, the gods smiling again upon her, she married a
foreman printer, and passes out of this story.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Mr. Reginald Peters&mdash;older, and the possessor,
perhaps, of more sense&mdash;looked at Miss Ramsbotham with new
eyes, and now not tolerated but desired her.&nbsp; Bohemia waited
to assist at the happy termination of a pretty and somewhat novel
romance.&nbsp; Miss Ramsbotham had shown no sign of being
attracted elsewhere.&nbsp; Flattery, compliment, she continued to
welcome; but merely, so it seemed, as favourable criticism.&nbsp;
Suitors more fit and proper were now not lacking, for Miss
Ramsbotham, though a woman less desirable when won, came readily
to the thought of wooing.&nbsp; But to all such she turned a
laughing face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I like her for it,&rdquo; declared Susan Fossett;
&ldquo;and he has improved&mdash;there was room for
it&mdash;though I wish it could have been some other.&nbsp; There
was Jack Herring&mdash;it would have been so much more
suitable.&nbsp; Or even Joe, in spite of his size.&nbsp; But
it&rsquo;s her wedding, not ours; and she will never care for
anyone else.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And Bohemia bought its presents, and had them ready, but never
gave them.&nbsp; A few months later Mr. Reginald Peters returned
to Canada, a bachelor.&nbsp; Miss Ramsbotham expressed her desire
for another private interview with Peter Hope.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I may as well keep on the Letter to Clorinda,&rdquo;
thought Miss Ramsbotham.&nbsp; &ldquo;I have got into the knack
of it.&nbsp; But I will get you to pay me for it in the ordinary
way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I would rather have done so from the beginning,&rdquo;
explained Peter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know.&nbsp; I could not in conscience, as I told you,
take from both sides.&nbsp; For the future&mdash;well, they have
said nothing; but I expect they are beginning to get tired of
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you!&rdquo; questioned Peter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&nbsp; I am tired of it myself,&rdquo; laughed Miss
Ramsbotham.&nbsp; &ldquo;Life isn&rsquo;t long enough to be a
well-dressed woman.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have done with all that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope so,&rdquo; answered Miss Ramsbotham.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And don&rsquo;t want to talk any more about it?&rdquo;
suggested Peter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not just at present.&nbsp; I should find it so
difficult to explain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>By others, less sympathetic than old Peter, vigorous attempts
were made to solve the mystery.&nbsp; Miss Ramsbotham took
enjoyment in cleverly evading these tormentors.&nbsp; Thwarted at
every point, the gossips turned to other themes.&nbsp; Miss
Ramsbotham found interest once again in the higher branches of
her calling; became again, by slow degrees, the sensible, frank,
&lsquo;good sort&rsquo; that Bohemia had known, liked,
respected&mdash;everything but loved.</p>
<p>Years later, to Susan Fossett, the case was made clear; and
through Susan Fossett, a nice enough woman but talkative, those
few still interested learned the explanation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Love,&rdquo; said Miss Ramsbotham to the bosom friend,
&ldquo;is not regulated by reason.&nbsp; As you say, there were
many men I might have married with much more hope of
happiness.&nbsp; But I never cared for any other man.&nbsp; He
was not intellectual, was egotistical, possibly enough
selfish.&nbsp; The man should always be older than the woman; he
was younger, and he was a weak character.&nbsp; Yet I loved
him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am glad you didn&rsquo;t marry him,&rdquo; said the
bosom friend.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So am I,&rdquo; agreed Miss Ramsbotham.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you can&rsquo;t trust me,&rdquo; had said the bosom
friend at this point, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I meant to do right,&rdquo; said Miss Ramsbotham,
&ldquo;upon my word of honour I did, in the beginning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand,&rdquo; said the bosom
friend.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If she had been my own child,&rdquo; continued Miss
Ramsbotham, &ldquo;I could not have done more&mdash;in the
beginning.&nbsp; I tried to teach her, to put some sense into
her.&nbsp; Lord! the hours I wasted on that little idiot!&nbsp; I
marvel at my own patience.&nbsp; She was nothing but an
animal.&nbsp; An animal! she had only an animal&rsquo;s
vices.&nbsp; To eat and drink and sleep was her idea of
happiness; her one ambition male admiration, and she hadn&rsquo;t
character enough to put sufficient curb upon her stomach to
retain it.&nbsp; I reasoned with her, I pleaded with her, I
bullied her.&nbsp; Had I persisted I might have succeeded by
sheer physical and mental strength in restraining her from
ruining herself.&nbsp; I was winning.&nbsp; I had made her
frightened of me.&nbsp; Had I gone on, I might have won.&nbsp; By
dragging her out of bed in the morning, by insisting upon her
taking exercise, by regulating every particle of food and drink
she put into her mouth, I kept the little beast in good condition
for nearly three months.&nbsp; Then, I had to go away into the
country for a few days; she swore she would obey my
instructions.&nbsp; When I came back I found she had been in bed
most of the time, and had been living chiefly on chocolate and
cakes.&nbsp; She was curled up asleep in an easy-chair, snoring
with her mouth wide open, when I opened the door.&nbsp; And at
sight of that picture the devil came to me and tempted me.&nbsp;
Why should I waste my time, wear myself out in mind and body,
that the man I loved should marry a pig because it looked like an
angel?&nbsp; &lsquo;Six months&rsquo; wallowing according to its
own desires would reveal it in its true shape.&nbsp; So from that
day I left it to itself.&nbsp; No, worse than that&mdash;I
don&rsquo;t want to spare myself&mdash;I encouraged her.&nbsp; I
let her have a fire in her bedroom, and half her meals in
bed.&nbsp; I let her have chocolate with tablespoonfuls of cream
floating on the top: she loved it.&nbsp; She was never really
happy except when eating.&nbsp; I let her order her own
meals.&nbsp; I took a fiendish delight watching the dainty limbs
turning to shapeless fat, the pink-and-white complexion growing
blotchy.&nbsp; It is flesh that man loves; brain and mind and
heart and soul! he never thinks of them.&nbsp; This little
pink-and-white sow could have cut me out with Solomon
himself.&nbsp; Why should such creatures have the world arranged
for them, and we not be allowed to use our brains in our own
defence?&nbsp; But for my looking-glass I might have resisted the
temptation, but I always had something of the man in me: the
sport of the thing appealed to me.&nbsp; I suppose it was the
nervous excitement under which I was living that was changing
me.&nbsp; All my sap was going into my body.&nbsp; Given
sufficient time, I might meet her with her own weapons, animal
against animal.&nbsp; Well, you know the result: I won.&nbsp;
There was no doubt about his being in love with me.&nbsp; His
eyes would follow me round the room, feasting on me.&nbsp; I had
become a fine animal.&nbsp; Men desired me, Do you know why I
refused him?&nbsp; He was in every way a better man than the
silly boy I had fallen in love with; but he came back with a
couple of false teeth: I saw the gold setting one day when he
opened his mouth to laugh.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t say for a moment,
my dear, there is no such thing as love&mdash;love pure,
ennobling, worthy of men and women, its roots in the heart and
nowhere else.&nbsp; But that love I had missed; and the
other!&nbsp; I saw it in its true light.&nbsp; I had fallen in
love with him because he was a pretty, curly-headed boy.&nbsp; He
had fallen in love with Peggy when she was pink-and-white and
slim.&nbsp; I shall always see the look that came into his eyes
when she spoke to him at the hotel, the look of disgust and
loathing.&nbsp; The girl was the same; it was only her body that
had grown older.&nbsp; I could see his eyes fixed upon my arms
and neck.&nbsp; I had got to grow old in time, brown skinned, and
wrinkled.&nbsp; I thought of him, growing bald,
fat&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you had fallen in love with the right man,&rdquo;
had said Susan Fossett, &ldquo;those ideas would not have come to
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know,&rdquo; said Miss Ramsbotham.&nbsp; &ldquo;He
will have to like me thin and in these clothes, just because I am
nice, and good company, and helpful.&nbsp; That is the man I am
waiting for.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He never came along.&nbsp; A charming, bright-eyed,
white-haired lady occupies alone a little flat in the Marylebone
Road, looks in occasionally at the Writers&rsquo; Club.&nbsp; She
is still Miss Ramsbotham.</p>
<p>Bald-headed gentlemen feel young again talking to her: she is
so sympathetic, so big-minded, so understanding.&nbsp; Then,
hearing the clock strike, tear themselves from her with a sigh,
and return home&mdash;some of them&mdash;to stupid shrewish
wives.</p>
<h2>STORY THE FIFTH&mdash;Joey Loveredge agrees&mdash;on certain
terms&mdash;to join the Company</h2>
<p>The most popular member of the Autolycus Club was undoubtedly
Joseph Loveredge.&nbsp; Small, chubby, clean-shaven, his somewhat
longish, soft, brown hair parted in the middle, strangers fell
into the error of assuming him to be younger than he really
was.&nbsp; It is on record that a leading lady
novelist&mdash;accepting her at her own estimate&mdash;irritated
by his polite but firm refusal to allow her entrance into his own
editorial office without appointment, had once boxed his ears,
under the impression that he was his own office-boy.&nbsp; Guests
to the Autolycus Club, on being introduced to him, would give to
him kind messages to take home to his father, with whom they
remembered having been at school together.&nbsp; This sort of
thing might have annoyed anyone with less sense of humour.&nbsp;
Joseph Loveredge would tell such stories himself, keenly enjoying
the jest&mdash;was even suspected of inventing some of the more
improbable.&nbsp; Another fact tending to the popularity of
Joseph Loveredge among all classes, over and above his
amiability, his wit, his genuine kindliness, and his
never-failing fund of good stories, was that by care and
inclination he had succeeded in remaining a bachelor.&nbsp; Many
had been the attempts to capture him; nor with the passing of the
years had interest in the sport shown any sign of
diminution.&nbsp; Well over the frailties and distempers so
dangerous to youth, of staid and sober habits, with an
ever-increasing capital invested in sound securities, together
with an ever-increasing income from his pen, with a tastefully
furnished house overlooking Regent&rsquo;s Park, an excellent and
devoted cook and house-keeper, and relatives mostly settled in
the Colonies, Joseph Loveredge, though inexperienced girls might
pass him by with a contemptuous sniff, was recognised by ladies
of maturer judgment as a prize not too often dangled before the
eyes of spinsterhood.&nbsp; Old foxes&mdash;so we are assured by
kind-hearted country gentlemen&mdash;rather enjoy than otherwise
a day with the hounds.&nbsp; However that may be, certain it is
that Joseph Loveredge, confident of himself, one presumes, showed
no particular disinclination to the chase.&nbsp; Perhaps on the
whole he preferred the society of his own sex, with whom he could
laugh and jest with more freedom, to whom he could tell his
stories as they came to him without the trouble of having to turn
them over first in his own mind; but, on the other hand, Joey
made no attempt to avoid female company whenever it came his way;
and then no cavalier could render himself more agreeable, more
unobtrusively attentive.&nbsp; Younger men stood by, in envious
admiration of the ease with which in five minutes he would
establish himself on terms of cosy friendship with the brilliant
beauty before whose gracious coldness they had stood shivering
for months; the daring with which he would tuck under his arm, so
to speak, the prettiest girl in the room, smooth down as if by
magic her hundred prickles, and tease her out of her overwhelming
sense of her own self-importance.&nbsp; The secret of his success
was, probably, that he was not afraid of them.&nbsp; Desiring
nothing from them beyond companionableness, a reasonable amount
of appreciation for his jokes&mdash;which without being
exceptionally stupid they would have found it difficult to
withhold&mdash;with just sufficient information and intelligence
to make conversation interesting, there was nothing about him by
which they could lay hold of him.&nbsp; Of course, that rendered
them particularly anxious to lay hold of him.&nbsp;
Joseph&rsquo;s lady friends might, roughly speaking, be divided
into two groups: the unmarried, who wanted to marry him to
themselves; and the married, who wanted to marry him to somebody
else.&nbsp; It would be a social disaster, the latter had agreed
among themselves, if Joseph Loveredge should never wed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He would make such an excellent husband for poor
Bridget.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Or Gladys.&nbsp; I wonder how old Gladys really
is?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Such a nice, kind little man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And when one thinks of the sort of men that <i>are</i>
married, it does seem such a pity!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wonder why he never has married, because he&rsquo;s
just the sort of man you&rsquo;d think <i>would</i> have
married.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wonder if he ever was in love.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, my dear, you don&rsquo;t mean to tell me that a man
has reached the age of forty without ever being in
love!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The ladies would sigh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do hope if ever he does marry, it will be somebody
nice.&nbsp; Men are so easily deceived.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shouldn&rsquo;t be surprised myself a bit if
something came of it with Bridget.&nbsp; She&rsquo;s a dear girl,
Bridget&mdash;so genuine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I think myself, dear, if it&rsquo;s anyone,
it&rsquo;s Gladys.&nbsp; I should be so glad to see poor dear
Gladys settled.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The unmarried kept their thoughts more to themselves.&nbsp;
Each one, upon reflection, saw ground for thinking that Joseph
Loveredge had given proof of feeling preference for
herself.&nbsp; The irritating thing was that, on further
reflection, it was equally clear that Joseph Loveredge had shown
signs of preferring most of the others.</p>
<p>Meanwhile Joseph Loveredge went undisturbed upon his
way.&nbsp; At eight o&rsquo;clock in the morning Joseph&rsquo;s
housekeeper entered the room with a cup of tea and a dry
biscuit.&nbsp; At eight-fifteen Joseph Loveredge arose and
performed complicated exercises on an indiarubber pulley,
warranted, if persevered in, to bestow grace upon the figure and
elasticity upon the limbs.&nbsp; Joseph Loveredge persevered
steadily, and had done so for years, and was himself contented
with the result, which, seeing it concerned nobody else, was all
that could be desired.&nbsp; At half-past eight on Mondays,
Wednesdays, and Fridays, Joseph Loveredge breakfasted on one cup
of tea, brewed by himself; one egg, boiled by himself; and two
pieces of toast, the first one spread with marmalade, the second
with butter.&nbsp; On Tuesdays, Thursdays, and Saturdays Joseph
Loveredge discarded eggs and ate a rasher of bacon.&nbsp; On
Sundays Joseph Loveredge had both eggs and bacon, but then
allowed himself half an hour longer for reading the paper.&nbsp;
At nine-thirty Joseph Loveredge left the house for the office of
the old-established journal of which he was the incorruptible and
honoured City editor.&nbsp; At one-forty-five, having left his
office at one-thirty, Joseph Loveredge entered the Autolycus Club
and sat down to lunch.&nbsp; Everything else in Joseph&rsquo;s
life was arranged with similar preciseness, so far as was
possible with the duties of a City editor.&nbsp; Monday evening
Joseph spent with musical friends at Brixton.&nbsp; Friday was
Joseph&rsquo;s theatre night.&nbsp; On Tuesdays and Thursdays he
was open to receive invitations out to dinner; on Wednesdays and
Saturdays he invited four friends to dine with him at
Regent&rsquo;s Park.&nbsp; On Sundays, whatever the season,
Joseph Loveredge took an excursion into the country.&nbsp; He had
his regular hours for reading, his regular hours for
thinking.&nbsp; Whether in Fleet Street, or the Tyrol, on the
Thames, or in the Vatican, you might recognise him from afar by
his grey frock-coat, his patent-leather boots, his brown felt
hat, his lavender tie.&nbsp; The man was a born bachelor.&nbsp;
When the news of his engagement crept through the smoky portals
of the Autolycus Club nobody believed it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Impossible!&rdquo; asserted Jack Herring.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve known Joey&rsquo;s life for fifteen
years.&nbsp; Every five minutes is arranged for.&nbsp; He could
never have found the time to do it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He doesn&rsquo;t like women, not in that way;
I&rsquo;ve heard him say so,&rdquo; explained Alexander the
Poet.&nbsp; &ldquo;His opinion is that women are the artists of
Society&mdash;delightful as entertainers, but troublesome to live
with.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I call to mind,&rdquo; said the Wee Laddie, &ldquo;a
story he told me in this verra room, barely three months agone:
Some half a dozen of them were gong home together from the
Devonshire.&nbsp; They had had a joyous evening, and one of
them&mdash;Joey did not notice which&mdash;suggested their
dropping in at his place just for a final whisky.&nbsp; They were
laughing and talking in the dining-room, when their hostess
suddenly appeared upon the scene in a costume&mdash;so Joey
described it&mdash;the charm of which was its variety.&nbsp; She
was a nice-looking woman, Joey said, but talked too much; and
when the first lull occurred, Joey turned to the man sitting
nighest to him, and who looked bored, and suggested in a whisper
that it was about time they went.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Perhaps you had better go,&rsquo; assented the
bored-looking man.&nbsp; &lsquo;Wish I could come with you; but,
you see, I live here.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe it,&rdquo; said Somerville the
Briefless.&nbsp; &ldquo;He&rsquo;s been cracking his jokes, and
some silly woman has taken him seriously.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But the rumour grew into report, developed detail, lost all
charm, expanded into plain recital of fact.&nbsp; Joey had not
been seen within the Club for more than a week&mdash;in itself a
deadly confirmation.&nbsp; The question became: Who was
she&mdash;what was she like?</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s none of our set, or we should have heard
something from her side before now,&rdquo; argued acutely
Somerville the Briefless.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some beastly kid who will invite us to dances and
forget the supper,&rdquo; feared Johnny Bulstrode, commonly
called the Babe.&nbsp; &ldquo;Old men always fall in love with
young girls.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Forty,&rdquo; explained severely Peter Hope, editor and
part proprietor of <i>Good Humour</i>, &ldquo;is not
old.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, it isn&rsquo;t young,&rdquo; persisted
Johnny.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good thing for you, Johnny, if it is a girl,&rdquo;
thought Jack Herring.&nbsp; &ldquo;Somebody for you to play
with.&nbsp; I often feel sorry for you, having nobody but
grown-up people to talk to.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They do get a bit stodgy after a certain age,&rdquo;
agreed the Babe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am hoping,&rdquo; said Peter, &ldquo;it will be some
sensible, pleasant woman, a little over thirty.&nbsp; He is a
dear fellow, Loveredge; and forty is a very good age for a man to
marry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, if I&rsquo;m not married before I&rsquo;m
forty&mdash;&rdquo; said the Babe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, don&rsquo;t you fret,&rdquo; Jack Herring
interrupted him&mdash;&ldquo;a pretty boy like you!&nbsp; We will
give a ball next season, and bring you out, if you&rsquo;re
good&mdash;get you off our hands in no time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was August.&nbsp; Joey went away for his holiday without
again entering the Club.&nbsp; The lady&rsquo;s name was
Henrietta Elizabeth Doone.&nbsp; It was said by the <i>Morning
Post</i> that she was connected with the Doones of
Gloucestershire.</p>
<p>Doones of Gloucestershire&mdash;Doones of Gloucestershire
mused Miss Ramsbotham, Society journalist, who wrote the weekly
Letter to Clorinda, discussing the matter with Peter Hope in the
editorial office of <i>Good Humour</i>.&nbsp; &ldquo;Knew a Doon
who kept a big second-hand store in Euston Road and called
himself an auctioneer.&nbsp; He bought a small place in
Gloucestershire and added an &lsquo;e&rsquo; to his name.&nbsp;
Wonder if it&rsquo;s the same?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I had a cat called Elizabeth once,&rdquo; said Peter
Hope.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see what that&rsquo;s got to do with
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, of course not,&rdquo; agreed Peter.&nbsp;
&ldquo;But I was rather fond of it.&nbsp; It was a quaint sort of
animal, considered as a cat&mdash;would never speak to another
cat, and hated being out after ten o&rsquo;clock at
night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What happened to it?&rdquo; demanded Miss
Ramsbotham.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fell off a roof,&rdquo; sighed Peter Hope.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Wasn&rsquo;t used to them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The marriage took place abroad, at the English Church at
Montreux.&nbsp; Mr. and Mrs. Loveredge returned at the end of
September.&nbsp; The Autolycus Club subscribed to send a present
of a punch-bowl, left cards, and waited with curiosity to see the
bride.&nbsp; But no invitation arrived.&nbsp; Nor for a month was
Joey himself seen within the Club.&nbsp; Then, one foggy
afternoon, waking after a doze, with a cold cigar in his mouth,
Jack Herring noticed he was not the only occupant of the
smoking-room.&nbsp; In a far corner, near a window, sat Joseph
Loveredge reading a magazine.&nbsp; Jack Herring rubbed his eyes,
then rose and crossed the room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought at first,&rdquo; explained Jack Herring,
recounting the incident later in the evening, &ldquo;that I must
be dreaming.&nbsp; There he sat, drinking his five o&rsquo;clock
whisky-and-soda, the same Joey Loveredge I had known for fifteen
years; yet not the same.&nbsp; Not a feature altered, not a hair
on his head changed, yet the whole face was different; the same
body, the same clothes, but another man.&nbsp; We talked for half
an hour; he remembered everything that Joey Loveredge had
known.&nbsp; I couldn&rsquo;t understand it.&nbsp; Then, as the
clock struck, and he rose, saying he must be home at half-past
five, the explanation suddenly occurred to me: <i>Joey Loveredge
was dead</i>; <i>this was a married man</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t want your feeble efforts at
psychological romance,&rdquo; told him Somerville the
Briefless.&nbsp; &ldquo;We want to know what you talked
about.&nbsp; Dead or married, the man who can drink
whisky-and-soda must be held responsible for his actions.&nbsp;
What&rsquo;s the little beggar mean by cutting us all in this
way?&nbsp; Did he ask after any of us?&nbsp; Did he leave any
message for any of us?&nbsp; Did he invite any of us to come an
see him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, he did ask after nearly everybody; I was coming to
that.&nbsp; But he didn&rsquo;t leave any message.&nbsp; I
didn&rsquo;t gather that he was pining for old relationships with
any of us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I shall go round to the office to-morrow
morning,&rdquo; said Somerville the Briefless, &ldquo;and force
my way in if necessary.&nbsp; This is getting
mysterious.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Somerville returned only to puzzle the Autolycus Club
still further.&nbsp; Joey had talked about the weather, the state
of political parties, had received with unfeigned interest all
gossip concerning his old friends; but about himself, his wife,
nothing had been gleaned.&nbsp; Mrs. Loveredge was well; Mrs.
Loveredge&rsquo;s relations were also well.&nbsp; But at present
Mrs. Loveredge was not receiving.</p>
<p>Members of the Autolycus Club with time upon their hands took
up the business of private detectives.&nbsp; Mrs. Loveredge
turned out to be a handsome, well-dressed lady of about thirty,
as Peter Hope had desired.&nbsp; At eleven in the morning, Mrs.
Loveredge shopped in the neighbourhood of the Hampstead
Road.&nbsp; In the afternoon, Mrs. Loveredge, in a hired
carriage, would slowly promenade the Park, looking, it was
noticed, with intense interest at the occupants of other
carriages as they passed, but evidently having no acquaintances
among them.&nbsp; The carriage, as a general rule, would call at
Joey&rsquo;s office at five, and Mr. and Mrs. Loveredge would
drive home.&nbsp; Jack Herring, as the oldest friend, urged by
the other members, took the bull by the horns and called
boldly.&nbsp; On neither occasion was Mrs. Loveredge at home.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m damned if I go again!&rdquo; said Jack.&nbsp;
&ldquo;She was in the second time, I know.&nbsp; I watched her
into the house.&nbsp; Confound the stuck-up pair of
them!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bewilderment gave place to indignation.&nbsp; Now and again
Joey would creep, a mental shadow of his former self, into the
Club where once every member would have risen with a smile to
greet him.&nbsp; They gave him curt answers and turned away from
him.&nbsp; Peter Hope one afternoon found him there alone,
standing with his hands in his pockets looking out of
window.&nbsp; Peter was fifty, so he said, maybe a little older;
men of forty were to him mere boys.&nbsp; So Peter, who hated
mysteries, stepped forward with a determined air and clapped Joey
on the shoulder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want to know, Joey,&rdquo; said Peter, &ldquo;I want
to know whether I am to go on liking you, or whether I&rsquo;ve
got to think poorly of you.&nbsp; Out with it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Joey turned to him a face so full of misery that Peter&rsquo;s
heart was touched.&nbsp; &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t tell how wretched
it makes me,&rdquo; said Joey.&nbsp; &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know
it was possible to feel so uncomfortable as I have felt during
these last three months.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the wife, I suppose?&rdquo; suggested
Peter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s a dear girl.&nbsp; She only has one
fault.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a pretty big one,&rdquo; returned
Peter.&nbsp; &ldquo;I should try and break her of it if I were
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Break her of it!&rdquo; cried the little man.&nbsp;
&ldquo;You might as well advise me to break a brick wall with my
head.&nbsp; I had no idea what they were like.&nbsp; I never
dreamt it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But what is her objection to us?&nbsp; We are clean, we
are fairly intelligent&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear Peter, do you think I haven&rsquo;t said all
that, and a hundred things more?&nbsp; A woman! she gets an idea
into her head, and every argument against it hammers it in
further.&nbsp; She has gained her notion of what she calls
Bohemia from the comic journals.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s our own fault,
we have done it ourselves.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s no persuading her
that it&rsquo;s a libel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Won&rsquo;t she see a few of us&mdash;judge for
herself?&nbsp; There&rsquo;s Porson&mdash;why Porson might have
been a bishop.&nbsp; Or Somerville&mdash;Somerville&rsquo;s
Oxford accent is wasted here.&nbsp; It has no chance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t only that,&rdquo; explained Joey;
&ldquo;she has ambitions, social ambitions.&nbsp; She thinks that
if we begin with the wrong set, we&rsquo;ll never get into the
right.&nbsp; We have three friends at present, and, so far as I
can see, are never likely to have any more.&nbsp; My dear boy,
you&rsquo;d never believe there could exist such bores.&nbsp;
There&rsquo;s a man and his wife named Holyoake.&nbsp; They dine
with us on Thursdays, and we dine with them on Tuesdays.&nbsp;
Their only title to existence consists in their having a cousin
in the House of Lords; they claim no other right
themselves.&nbsp; He is a widower, getting on for eighty.&nbsp;
Apparently he&rsquo;s the only relative they have, and when he
dies, they talk of retiring into the country.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s
a fellow named Cutler, who visited once at Marlborough House in
connection with a charity.&nbsp; You&rsquo;d think to listen to
him that he had designs upon the throne.&nbsp; The most tiresome
of them all is a noisy woman who, as far as I can make out,
hasn&rsquo;t any name at all.&nbsp; &lsquo;Miss Montgomery&rsquo;
is on her cards, but that is only what she calls herself.&nbsp;
Who she really is!&nbsp; It would shake the foundations of
European society if known.&nbsp; We sit and talk about the
aristocracy; we don&rsquo;t seem to know anybody else.&nbsp; I
tried on one occasion a little sarcasm as a
corrective&mdash;recounted conversations between myself and the
Prince of Wales, in which I invariably addressed him as
&lsquo;Teddy.&rsquo;&nbsp; It sounds tall, I know, but those
people took it in.&nbsp; I was too astonished to undeceive them
at the time, the consequence is I am a sort of little god to
them.&nbsp; They come round me and ask for more.&nbsp; What am I
to do?&nbsp; I am helpless among them.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve never had
anything to do before with the really first-prize idiot; the
usual type, of course, one knows, but these, if you haven&rsquo;t
met them, are inconceivable.&nbsp; I try insulting them; they
don&rsquo;t even know I am insulting them.&nbsp; Short of
dragging them out of their chairs and kicking them round the
room, I don&rsquo;t see how to make them understand
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And Mrs. Loveredge?&rdquo; asked the sympathetic Peter,
&ldquo;is she&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Between ourselves,&rdquo; said Joey, sinking his voice
to a needless whisper, seeing he and Peter were the sole
occupants of the smoking-room&mdash;&ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t, of
course, say it to a younger man&mdash;but between ourselves, my
wife is a charming woman.&nbsp; You don&rsquo;t know
her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Doesn&rsquo;t seem much chance of my ever doing
so,&rdquo; laughed Peter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So graceful, so dignified, so&mdash;so queenly,&rdquo;
continued the little man, with rising enthusiasm.&nbsp;
&ldquo;She has only one fault&mdash;she has no sense of
humour.&rdquo;</p>
<p>To Peter, as it has been said, men of forty were mere
boys.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear fellow, whatever could have induced
you&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know&mdash;I know all that,&rdquo; interrupted the
mere boy.&nbsp; &ldquo;Nature arranges it on purpose.&nbsp; Tall
and solemn prigs marry little women with turned-up noses.&nbsp;
Cheerful little fellows like myself&mdash;we marry serious,
stately women.&nbsp; If it were otherwise, the human race would
be split up into species.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course, if you were actuated by a sense of public
duty&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be a fool, Peter Hope,&rdquo; returned the
little man.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m in love with my wife just as
she is, and always shall be.&nbsp; I know the woman with a sense
of humour, and of the two I prefer the one without.&nbsp; The
Juno type is my ideal.&nbsp; I must take the rough with the
smooth.&nbsp; One can&rsquo;t have a jolly, chirpy Juno, and
wouldn&rsquo;t care for her if one could.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then are you going to give up all your old
friends?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t suggest it,&rdquo; pleaded the little
man.&nbsp; &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t know how miserable it makes
me&mdash;the mere idea.&nbsp; Tell them to be patient.&nbsp; The
secret of dealing with women, I have found, is to do nothing
rashly.&rdquo;&nbsp; The clock struck five.&nbsp; &ldquo;I must
go now,&rdquo; said Joey.&nbsp; &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t misjudge her,
Peter, and don&rsquo;t let the others.&nbsp; She&rsquo;s a dear
girl.&nbsp; You&rsquo;ll like her, all of you, when you know
her.&nbsp; A dear girl!&nbsp; She only has that one
fault.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Joey went out.</p>
<p>Peter did his best that evening to explain the true position
of affairs without imputing snobbery to Mrs. Loveredge.&nbsp; It
was a difficult task, and Peter cannot be said to have
accomplished it successfully.&nbsp; Anger and indignation against
Joey gave place to pity.&nbsp; The members of the Autolycus Club
also experienced a little irritation on their own account.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What does the woman take us for?&rdquo; demanded
Somerville the Briefless.&nbsp; &ldquo;Doesn&rsquo;t she know
that we lunch with real actors and actresses, that once a year we
are invited to dine at the Mansion House?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Has she never heard of the aristocracy of
genius?&rdquo; demanded Alexander the Poet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The explanation may be that possibly she has seen
it,&rdquo; feared the Wee Laddie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One of us ought to waylay the woman,&rdquo; argued the
Babe&mdash;&ldquo;insist upon her talking to him for ten
minutes.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve half a mind to do it myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jack Herring said nothing&mdash;seemed thoughtful.</p>
<p>The next morning Jack Herring, still thoughtful, called at the
editorial offices of <i>Good Humour</i>, in Crane Court, and
borrowed Miss Ramsbotham&rsquo;s Debrett.&nbsp; Three days later
Jack Herring informed the Club casually that he had dined the
night before with Mr. and Mrs. Loveredge.&nbsp; The Club gave
Jack Herring politely to understand that they regarded him as a
liar, and proceeded to demand particulars.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I wasn&rsquo;t there,&rdquo; explained Jack Herring,
with unanswerable logic, &ldquo;how can I tell you anything about
it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>This annoyed the Club, whose curiosity had been whetted.&nbsp;
Three members, acting in the interests of the whole, solemnly
undertook to believe whatever he might tell them.&nbsp; But Jack
Herring&rsquo;s feelings had been wounded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When gentlemen cast a doubt upon another
gentleman&rsquo;s veracity&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We didn&rsquo;t cast a doubt,&rdquo; explained
Somerville the Briefless.&nbsp; &ldquo;We merely said that we
personally did not believe you.&nbsp; We didn&rsquo;t say we
couldn&rsquo;t believe you; it is a case for individual
effort.&nbsp; If you give us particulars bearing the impress of
reality, supported by details that do not unduly contradict each
other, we are prepared to put aside our natural suspicions and
face the possibility of your statement being correct.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was foolish of me,&rdquo; said Jack Herring.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I thought perhaps it would amuse you to hear what sort of
a woman Mrs. Loveredge was like&mdash;some description of Mrs.
Loveredge&rsquo;s uncle.&nbsp; Miss Montgomery, friend of Mrs.
Loveredge, is certainly one of the most remarkable women I have
ever met.&nbsp; Of course, that isn&rsquo;t her real name.&nbsp;
But, as I have said, it was foolish of me.&nbsp; These
people&mdash;you will never meet them, you will never see them;
of what interest can they be to you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They had forgotten to draw down the blinds, and he
climbed up a lamp-post and looked through the window,&rdquo; was
the solution of the problem put forward by the Wee Laddie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m dining there again on Saturday,&rdquo;
volunteered Jack Herring.&nbsp; &ldquo;If any of you will promise
not to make a disturbance, you can hang about on the Park side,
underneath the shadow of the fence, and watch me go in.&nbsp; My
hansom will draw up at the door within a few minutes of
eight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Babe and the Poet agreed to undertake the test.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You won&rsquo;t mind our hanging round a little while,
in case you&rsquo;re thrown out again?&rdquo; asked the Babe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not in the least, so far as I am concerned,&rdquo;
replied Jack Herring.&nbsp; &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t leave it too late
and make your mother anxious.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s true enough,&rdquo; the Babe recounted
afterwards.&nbsp; &ldquo;The door was opened by a manservant and
he went straight in.&nbsp; We walked up and down for half an
hour, and unless they put him out the back way, he&rsquo;s
telling the truth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you hear him give his name?&rdquo; asked
Somerville, who was stroking his moustache.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, we were too far off,&rdquo; explained the
Babe.&nbsp; &ldquo;But&mdash;I&rsquo;ll swear it was
Jack&mdash;there couldn&rsquo;t be any mistake about
that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps not,&rdquo; agreed Somerville the
Briefless.</p>
<p>Somerville the Briefless called at the offices of <i>Good
Humour</i>, in Crane Court, the following morning, and he also
borrowed Miss Ramsbotham&rsquo;s Debrett.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the meaning of it?&rdquo; demanded the
sub-editor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Meaning of what?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This sudden interest of all you fellows in the British
Peerage.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All of us?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, Herring was here last week, poring over that book
for half an hour, with the <i>Morning Post</i> spread out before
him.&nbsp; Now you&rsquo;re doing the same thing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah!&nbsp; Jack Herring, was he?&nbsp; I thought as
much.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t talk about it, Tommy.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll
tell you later on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On the following Monday, the Briefless one announced to the
Club that he had received an invitation to dine at the
Loveredges&rsquo; on the following Wednesday.&nbsp; On Tuesday,
the Briefless one entered the Club with a slow and stately
step.&nbsp; Halting opposite old Goslin the porter, who had
emerged from his box with the idea of discussing the Oxford and
Cambridge boat race, Somerville, removing his hat with a sweep of
the arm, held it out in silence.&nbsp; Old Goslin, much
astonished, took it mechanically, whereupon the Briefless one,
shaking himself free from his Inverness cape, flung it lightly
after the hat, and strolled on, not noticing that old Goslin,
unaccustomed to coats lightly and elegantly thrown at him,
dropping the hat, had caught it on his head, and had been, in the
language of the prompt-book, &ldquo;left struggling.&rdquo;&nbsp;
The Briefless one, entering the smoking-room, lifted a chair and
let it fall again with a crash, and sitting down upon it, crossed
his legs and rang the bell.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ye&rsquo;re doing it verra weel,&rdquo; remarked
approvingly the Wee Laddie.&nbsp; &ldquo;Ye&rsquo;re just fitted
for it by nature.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fitted for what?&rdquo; demanded the Briefless one,
waking up apparently from a dream.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For an Adelphi guest at eighteenpence the night,&rdquo;
assured him the Wee Laddie.&nbsp; &ldquo;Ye&rsquo;re just
splendid at it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Briefless one, muttering that the worst of mixing with
journalists was that if you did not watch yourself, you fell into
their ways, drank his whisky in silence.&nbsp; Later, the Babe
swore on a copy of <i>Sell&rsquo;s Advertising Guide</i> that,
crossing the Park, he had seen the Briefless one leaning over the
railings of Rotten Row, clad in a pair of new kid gloves,
swinging a silver-headed cane.</p>
<p>One morning towards the end of the week, Joseph Loveredge,
looking twenty years younger than when Peter had last seen him,
dropped in at the editorial office of <i>Good Humour</i> and
demanded of Peter Hope how he felt and what he thought of the
present price of Emma Mines.</p>
<p>Peter Hope&rsquo;s fear was that the gambling fever was
spreading to all classes of society.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want you to dine with us on Sunday,&rdquo; said
Joseph Loveredge.&nbsp; &ldquo;Jack Herring will be there.&nbsp;
You might bring Tommy with you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Peter Hope gulped down his astonishment and said he should be
delighted; he thought that Tommy also was disengaged.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Mrs. Loveredge out of town, I presume?&rdquo; questioned
Peter Hope.</p>
<p>&ldquo;On the contrary,&rdquo; replied Joseph Loveredge,
&ldquo;I want you to meet her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Joseph Loveredge removed a pile of books from one chair and
placed them carefully upon another, after which he went and stood
before the fire.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t if you don&rsquo;t like,&rdquo; said Joseph
Loveredge; &ldquo;but if you don&rsquo;t mind, you might call
yourself, just for the evening&mdash;say, the Duke of
Warrington.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say the what?&rdquo; demanded Peter Hope.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Duke of Warrington,&rdquo; repeated Joey.&nbsp;
&ldquo;We are rather short of dukes.&nbsp; Tommy can be the Lady
Adelaide, your daughter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be an ass!&rdquo; said Peter Hope.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not an ass,&rdquo; assured him Joseph
Loveredge.&nbsp; &ldquo;He is wintering in Egypt.&nbsp; You have
run back for a week to attend to business.&nbsp; There is no Lady
Adelaide, so that&rsquo;s quite simple.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But what in the name of&mdash;&rdquo; began Peter
Hope.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you see what I&rsquo;m driving at?&rdquo;
persisted Joey.&nbsp; &ldquo;It was Jack&rsquo;s idea at the
beginning.&nbsp; I was frightened myself at first, but it is
working to perfection.&nbsp; She sees you, and sees that you are
a gentleman.&nbsp; When the truth comes out&mdash;as, of course,
it must later on&mdash;the laugh will be against her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You think&mdash;you think that&rsquo;ll comfort
her?&rdquo; suggested Peter Hope.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the only way, and it is really wonderfully
simple.&nbsp; We never mention the aristocracy now&mdash;it would
be like talking shop.&nbsp; We just enjoy ourselves.&nbsp; You,
by the way, I met in connection with the movement for rational
dress.&nbsp; You are a bit of a crank, fond of frequenting
Bohemian circles.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am risking something, I know,&rdquo; continued Joey;
&ldquo;but it&rsquo;s worth it.&nbsp; I couldn&rsquo;t have
existed much longer.&nbsp; We go slowly, and are very
careful.&nbsp; Jack is Lord Mount-Primrose, who has taken up with
anti-vaccination and who never goes out into Society.&nbsp;
Somerville is Sir Francis Baldwin, the great authority on
centipedes.&nbsp; The Wee Laddie is coming next week as Lord
Garrick, who married that dancing-girl, Prissy Something, and
started a furniture shop in Bond Street.&nbsp; I had some
difficulty at first.&nbsp; She wanted to send out paragraphs, but
I explained that was only done by vulgar persons&mdash;that when
the nobility came to you as friends, it was considered bad
taste.&nbsp; She is a dear girl, as I have always told you, with
only one fault.&nbsp; A woman easier to deceive one could not
wish for.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t myself see why the truth ever need
come out&mdash;provided we keep our heads.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Seems to me you&rsquo;ve lost them already,&rdquo;
commented Peter; &ldquo;you&rsquo;re overdoing it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The more of us the better,&rdquo; explained Joey;
&ldquo;we help each other.&nbsp; Besides, I particularly want you
in it.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s a sort of superior Pickwickian
atmosphere surrounding you that disarms suspicion.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You leave me out of it,&rdquo; growled Peter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;See here,&rdquo; laughed Joey; &ldquo;you come as the
Duke of Warrington, and bring Tommy with you, and I&rsquo;ll
write your City article.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For how long?&rdquo; snapped Peter.&nbsp; Incorruptible
City editors are not easily picked up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, well, for as long as you like.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;On that understanding,&rdquo; agreed Peter,
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m willing to make a fool of myself in your
company.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll soon get used to it,&rdquo; Joey told him;
&ldquo;eight o&rsquo;clock, then, on Sunday; plain evening
dress.&nbsp; If you like to wear a bit of red ribbon in your
buttonhole, why, do so.&nbsp; You can get it at Evans&rsquo;, in
Covent Garden.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And Tommy is the Lady&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Adelaide.&nbsp; Let her have a taste for literature,
then she needn&rsquo;t wear gloves.&nbsp; I know she hates
them.&rdquo;&nbsp; Joey turned to go.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Am I married?&rdquo; asked Peter.</p>
<p>Joey paused.&nbsp; &ldquo;I should avoid all reference to your
matrimonial affairs if I were you,&rdquo; was Joey&rsquo;s
advice.&nbsp; &ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t come out of that business
too well.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! as bad as that, was I?&nbsp; You don&rsquo;t think
Mrs. Loveredge will object to me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have asked her that.&nbsp; She&rsquo;s a dear,
broad-minded girl.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve promised not to leave you
alone with Miss Montgomery, and Willis has had instructions not
to let you mix your drinks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d have liked to have been someone a trifle more
respectable,&rdquo; grumbled Peter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We rather wanted a duke,&rdquo; explained Joey,
&ldquo;and he was the only one that fitted in all
round.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The dinner a was a complete success.&nbsp; Tommy, entering
into the spirit of the thing, bought a new pair of open-work
stockings and assumed a languid drawl.&nbsp; Peter, who was
growing forgetful, introduced her as the Lady Alexandra; it did
not seem to matter, both beginning with an A.&nbsp; She greeted
Lord Mount-Primrose as &ldquo;Billy,&rdquo; and asked
affectionately after his mother.&nbsp; Joey told his raciest
stories.&nbsp; The Duke of Warrington called everybody by their
Christian names, and seemed well acquainted with Bohemian
society&mdash;a more amiable nobleman it would have been
impossible to discover.&nbsp; The lady whose real name was not
Miss Montgomery sat in speechless admiration.&nbsp; The hostess
was the personification of gracious devotion.</p>
<p>Other little dinners, equally successful, followed.&nbsp;
Joey&rsquo;s acquaintanceship appeared to be confined exclusively
to the higher circles of the British aristocracy&mdash;with one
exception: that of a German baron, a short, stout gentleman, who
talked English well, but with an accent, and who, when he desired
to be impressive, laid his right forefinger on the right side of
his nose and thrust his whole face forward.&nbsp; Mrs. Loveredge
wondered why her husband had not introduced them sooner, but was
too blissful to be suspicious.&nbsp; The Autolycus Club was
gradually changing its tone.&nbsp; Friends could no longer
recognise one another by the voice.&nbsp; Every corner had its
solitary student practising high-class intonation.&nbsp; Members
dropped into the habit of addressing one another as &ldquo;dear
chappie,&rdquo; and, discarding pipes, took to cheap
cigars.&nbsp; Many of the older <i>habitu&eacute;s</i>
resigned.</p>
<p>All might have gone well to the end of time if only Mrs.
Loveredge had left all social arrangements in the hands of her
husband&mdash;had not sought to aid his efforts.&nbsp; To a
certain political garden-party, one day in the height of the
season, were invited Joseph Loveredge and Mrs. Joseph Loveredge,
his wife.&nbsp; Mr. Joseph Loveredge at the last moment found
himself unable to attend.&nbsp; Mrs. Joseph Loveredge went alone,
met there various members of the British aristocracy.&nbsp; Mrs.
Joseph Loveredge, accustomed to friendship with the aristocracy,
felt at her ease and was natural and agreeable.&nbsp; The wife of
an eminent peer talked to her and liked her.&nbsp; It occurred to
Mrs. Joseph Loveredge that this lady might be induced to visit
her house in Regent&rsquo;s Park, there to mingle with those of
her own class.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lord Mount-Primrose, the Duke of Warrington, and a few
others will be dining with us on Sunday next,&rdquo; suggested
Mrs. Loveredge.&nbsp; &ldquo;Will not you do us the honour of
coming?&nbsp; We are, of course, only simple folk ourselves, but
somehow people seem to like us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The wife of the eminent peer looked at Mrs. Loveredge, looked
round the grounds, looked at Mrs. Loveredge again, and said she
would like to come.&nbsp; Mrs. Joseph Loveredge intended at first
to tell her husband of her success, but a little devil entering
into her head and whispering to her that it would be amusing, she
resolved to keep it as a surprise, to be sprung upon him at eight
o&rsquo;clock on Sunday.&nbsp; The surprise proved all she could
have hoped for.</p>
<p>The Duke of Warrington, having journalistic matters to discuss
with Joseph Loveredge, arrived at half-past seven, wearing on his
shirt-front a silver star, purchased in Eagle Street the day
before for eight-and-six.&nbsp; There accompanied him the Lady
Alexandra, wearing the identical ruby necklace that every night
for the past six months, and twice on Saturdays, &ldquo;John
Strongheart&rdquo; had been falsely accused of stealing.&nbsp;
Lord Garrick, having picked up his wife (Miss Ramsbotham) outside
the Mother Redcap, arrived with her on foot at a quarter to
eight.&nbsp; Lord Mount-Primrose, together with Sir Francis
Baldwin, dashed up in a hansom at seven-fifty.&nbsp; His
Lordship, having lost the toss, paid the fare.&nbsp; The Hon.
Harry Sykes (commonly called &ldquo;the Babe&rdquo;) was ushered
in five minutes later.&nbsp; The noble company assembled in the
drawing-room chatted blithely while waiting for dinner to be
announced.&nbsp; The Duke of Warrington was telling an anecdote
about a cat, which nobody appeared to believe.&nbsp; Lord
Mount-Primrose desired to know whether by any chance it might be
the same animal that every night at half-past nine had been in
the habit of climbing up his Grace&rsquo;s railings and knocking
at his Grace&rsquo;s door.&nbsp; The Honourable Harry was saying
that, speaking of cats, he once had a sort of terrier&mdash;when
the door was thrown open and Willis announced the Lady Mary
Sutton.</p>
<p>Mr. Joseph Loveredge, who was sitting near the fire, rose
up.&nbsp; Lord Mount-Primrose, who was standing near the piano,
sat down.&nbsp; The Lady Mary Sutton paused in the doorway.&nbsp;
Mrs. Loveredge crossed the room to greet her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let me introduce you to my husband,&rdquo; said Mrs.
Loveredge.&nbsp; &ldquo;Joey, my dear, the Lady Mary
Sutton.&nbsp; I met the Lady Mary at the O&rsquo;Meyers&rsquo;
the other day, and she was good enough to accept my
invitation.&nbsp; I forgot to tell you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Loveredge said he was delighted; after which, although as
a rule a chatty man, he seemed to have nothing else to say.&nbsp;
And a silence fell.</p>
<p>Somerville the Briefless&mdash;till then.&nbsp; That evening
has always been reckoned the starting-point of his career.&nbsp;
Up till then nobody thought he had much in him&mdash;walked up
and held out his hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t remember me, Lady Mary,&rdquo; said the
Briefless one.&nbsp; &ldquo;I met you some years ago; we had a
most interesting conversation&mdash;Sir Francis
Baldwin.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Lady Mary stood for a moment trying apparently to
recollect.&nbsp; She was a handsome, fresh-complexioned woman of
about forty, with frank, agreeable eyes.&nbsp; The Lady Mary
glanced at Lord Garrick, who was talking rapidly to Lord
Mount-Primrose, who was not listening, and who could not have
understood even if he had been, Lord Garrick, without being aware
of it, having dropped into broad Scotch.&nbsp; From him the Lady
Mary glanced at her hostess, and from her hostess to her
host.</p>
<p>The Lady Mary took the hand held out to her.&nbsp; &ldquo;Of
course,&rdquo; said the Lady Mary; &ldquo;how stupid of me!&nbsp;
It was the day of my own wedding, too.&nbsp; You really must
forgive me.&nbsp; We talked of quite a lot of things.&nbsp; I
remember now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Loveredge, who prided herself upon maintaining
old-fashioned courtesies, proceeded to introduce the Lady Mary to
her fellow-guests, a little surprised that her ladyship appeared
to know so few of them.&nbsp; Her ladyship&rsquo;s greeting of
the Duke of Warrington was accompanied, it was remarked, by a
somewhat curious smile.&nbsp; To the Duke of Warrington&rsquo;s
daughter alone did the Lady Mary address remark.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear,&rdquo; said the Lady Mary, &ldquo;how you have
grown since last we met!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The announcement of dinner, as everybody felt, came none too
soon.</p>
<p>It was not a merry feast.&nbsp; Joey told but one story; he
told it three times, and twice left out the point.&nbsp; Lord
Mount-Primrose took sifted sugar with <i>p&acirc;t&egrave; de
foie gras</i> and ate it with a spoon.&nbsp; Lord Garrick,
talking a mixture of Scotch and English, urged his wife to give
up housekeeping and take a flat in Gower Street, which, as he
pointed out, was central.&nbsp; She could have her meals sent in
to her and so avoid all trouble.&nbsp; The Lady Alexandra&rsquo;s
behaviour appeared to Mrs. Loveredge not altogether
well-bred.&nbsp; An eccentric young noblewoman Mrs. Loveredge had
always found her, but wished on this occasion that she had been a
little less eccentric.&nbsp; Every few minutes the Lady Alexandra
buried her face in her serviette, and shook and rocked, emitting
stifled sounds, apparently those of acute physical pain.&nbsp;
Mrs. Loveredge hoped she was not feeling ill, but the Lady
Alexandra appeared incapable of coherent reply.&nbsp; Twice
during the meal the Duke of Warrington rose from the table and
began wandering round the room; on each occasion, asked what he
wanted, had replied meekly that he was merely looking for his
snuff-box, and had sat down again.&nbsp; The only person who
seemed to enjoy the dinner was the Lady Mary Sutton.</p>
<p>The ladies retired upstairs into the drawing-room.&nbsp; Mrs.
Loveredge, breaking a long silence, remarked it as unusual that
no sound of merriment reached them from the dining-room.&nbsp;
The explanation was that the entire male portion of the party, on
being left to themselves, had immediately and in a body crept on
tiptoe into Joey&rsquo;s study, which, fortunately, happened to
be on the ground floor.&nbsp; Joey, unlocking the bookcase, had
taken out his Debrett, but appeared incapable of understanding
it.&nbsp; Sir Francis Baldwin had taken it from his unresisting
hands; the remaining aristocracy huddled themselves into a corner
and waited in silence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think I&rsquo;ve got it all clearly,&rdquo; announced
Sir Francis Baldwin, after five minutes, which to the others had
been an hour.&nbsp; &ldquo;Yes, I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;m
making any mistake.&nbsp; She&rsquo;s the daughter of the Duke of
Truro, married in &rsquo;53 the Duke of Warrington, at St.
Peter&rsquo;s, Eaton Square; gave birth in &rsquo;55 to a
daughter, the Lady Grace Alexandra Warberton Sutton, which makes
the child just thirteen.&nbsp; In &rsquo;63 divorced the Duke of
Warrington.&nbsp; Lord Mount-Primrose, so far as I can make out,
must be her second cousin.&nbsp; I appear to have married her in
&rsquo;66 at Hastings.&nbsp; It doesn&rsquo;t seem to me that we
could have got together a homelier little party to meet her even
if we had wanted to.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nobody spoke; nobody had anything particularly worth
saying.&nbsp; The door opened, and the Lady Alexandra (otherwise
Tommy) entered the room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t it time,&rdquo; suggested the Lady
Alexandra, &ldquo;that some of you came upstairs?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was thinking myself,&rdquo; explained Joey, the host,
with a grim smile, &ldquo;it was about time that I went out and
drowned myself.&nbsp; The canal is handy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Put it off till to-morrow,&rdquo; Tommy advised
him.&nbsp; &ldquo;I have asked her ladyship to give me a lift
home, and she has promised to do so.&nbsp; She is evidently a
woman with a sense of humour.&nbsp; Wait till after I have had a
talk with her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Six men, whispering at the same time, were prepared with
advice; but Tommy was not taking advice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come upstairs, all of you,&rdquo; insisted Tommy,
&ldquo;and make yourselves agreeable.&nbsp; She&rsquo;s going in
a quarter of an hour.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Six silent men, the host leading, the two husbands bringing up
the rear, ascended the stairs, each with the sensation of being
twice his usual weight.&nbsp; Six silent men entered the
drawing-room and sat down on chairs.&nbsp; Six silent men tried
to think of something interesting to say.</p>
<p>Miss Ramsbotham&mdash;it was that or hysterics, as she
afterwards explained&mdash;stifling a sob, opened the
piano.&nbsp; But the only thing she could remember was
&ldquo;Champagne Charlie is my Name,&rdquo; a song then popular
in the halls.&nbsp; Five men, when she had finished, begged her
to go on.&nbsp; Miss Ramsbotham, speaking in a shrill falsetto,
explained it was the only tune she knew.&nbsp; Four of them
begged her to play it again.&nbsp; Miss Ramsbotham played it a
second time with involuntary variations.</p>
<p>The Lady Mary&rsquo;s carriage was announced by the
imperturbable Willis.&nbsp; The party, with the exception of the
Lady Mary and the hostess, suppressed with difficulty an
inclination to burst into a cheer.&nbsp; The Lady Mary thanked
Mrs. Loveredge for a most interesting evening, and beckoned Tommy
to accompany her.&nbsp; With her disappearance, a wild hilarity,
uncanny in its suddenness, took possession of the remaining
guests.</p>
<p>A few days later, the Lady Mary&rsquo;s carriage again drew up
before the little house in Regent&rsquo;s Park.&nbsp; Mrs.
Loveredge, fortunately, was at home.&nbsp; The carriage remained
waiting for quite a long time.&nbsp; Mrs. Loveredge, after it was
gone, locked herself in her own room.&nbsp; The under-housemaid
reported to the kitchen that, passing the door, she had detected
sounds indicative of strong emotion.</p>
<p>Through what ordeal Joseph Loveredge passed was never
known.&nbsp; For a few weeks the Autolycus Club missed him.&nbsp;
Then gradually, as aided by Time they have a habit of doing,
things righted themselves.&nbsp; Joseph Loveredge received his
old friends; his friends received Joseph Loveredge.&nbsp; Mrs.
Loveredge, as a hostess, came to have only one failing&mdash;a
marked coldness of demeanour towards all people with titles,
whenever introduced to her.</p>
<h2>STORY THE SIXTH&mdash;&ldquo;The Babe&rdquo; applies for
Shares</h2>
<p>People said of the new journal, <i>Good
Humour</i>&mdash;people of taste and judgment, that it was the
brightest, the cleverest, the most literary penny weekly that
ever had been offered to the public.&nbsp; This made Peter Hope,
editor and part-proprietor, very happy.&nbsp; William Clodd,
business manager, and also part-proprietor, it left less
elated.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Must be careful,&rdquo; said William Clodd, &ldquo;that
we don&rsquo;t make it too clever.&nbsp; Happy medium,
that&rsquo;s the ideal.&rdquo;</p>
<p>People said&mdash;people of taste and judgment, that <i>Good
Humour</i> was more worthy of support than all the other penny
weeklies put together.&nbsp; People of taste and judgment even
went so far, some of them, as to buy it.&nbsp; Peter Hope,
looking forward, saw fame and fortune coming to him.</p>
<p>William Clodd, looking round about him, said&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Doesn&rsquo;t it occur to you, Guv&rsquo;nor, that
we&rsquo;re getting this thing just a trifle too high
class?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What makes you think that?&rdquo; demanded Peter
Hope.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our circulation, for one thing,&rdquo; explained
Clodd.&nbsp; &ldquo;The returns for last month&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d rather you didn&rsquo;t mention them, if you
don&rsquo;t mind,&rdquo; interrupted Peter Hope; &ldquo;somehow,
hearing the actual figures always depresses me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t say I feel inspired by them myself,&rdquo;
admitted Clodd.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It will come,&rdquo; said Peter Hope, &ldquo;it will
come in time.&nbsp; We must educate the public up to our
level.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If there is one thing, so far as I have noticed,&rdquo;
said William Clodd, &ldquo;that the public are inclined to pay
less for than another, it is for being educated.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are we to do?&rdquo; asked Peter Hope.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What you want,&rdquo; answered William Clodd, &ldquo;is
an office-boy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How will our having an office-boy increase our
circulation?&rdquo; demanded Peter Hope.&nbsp; &ldquo;Besides, it
was agreed that we could do without one for the first year.&nbsp;
Why suggest more expense?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t mean an ordinary office-boy,&rdquo;
explained Clodd.&nbsp; &ldquo;I mean the sort of boy that I rode
with in the train going down to Stratford yesterday.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What was there remarkable about him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing.&nbsp; He was reading the current number of the
<i>Penny Novelist</i>.&nbsp; Over two hundred thousand people buy
it.&nbsp; He is one of them.&nbsp; He told me so.&nbsp; When he
had done with it, he drew from his pocket a copy of the
<i>Halfpenny Joker</i>&mdash;they guarantee a circulation of
seventy thousand.&nbsp; He sat and chuckled over it until we got
to Bow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You wait a minute.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m coming to the
explanation.&nbsp; That boy represents the reading public.&nbsp;
I talked to him.&nbsp; The papers he likes best are the papers
that have the largest sales.&nbsp; He never made a single
mistake.&nbsp; The others&mdash;those of them he had
seen&mdash;he dismissed as &lsquo;rot.&rsquo;&nbsp; What he likes
is what the great mass of the journal-buying public likes.&nbsp;
Please him&mdash;I took his name and address, and he is willing
to come to us for eight shillings a week&mdash;and you please the
people that buy.&nbsp; Not the people that glance through a paper
when it is lying on the smoking-room table, and tell you it is
damned good, but the people that plank down their penny.&nbsp;
That&rsquo;s the sort we want.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Peter Hope, able editor, with ideals, was
shocked&mdash;indignant.&nbsp; William Clodd, business man,
without ideals, talked figures.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s the advertiser to be thought of,&rdquo;
persisted Clodd.&nbsp; &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t pretend to be a
George Washington, but what&rsquo;s the use of telling lies that
sound like lies, even to one&rsquo;s self while one&rsquo;s
telling them?&nbsp; Give me a genuine sale of twenty thousand,
and I&rsquo;ll undertake, without committing myself, to convey an
impression of forty.&nbsp; But when the actual figures are under
eight thousand&mdash;well, it hampers you, if you happen to have
a conscience.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Give them every week a dozen columns of good, sound
literature,&rdquo; continued Clodd insinuatingly, &ldquo;but wrap
it up in twenty-four columns of jam.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s the only
way they&rsquo;ll take it, and you will be doing them
good&mdash;educating them without their knowing it.&nbsp; All
powder and no jam!&nbsp; Well, they don&rsquo;t open their
mouths, that&rsquo;s all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Clodd was a man who knew how to get his way.&nbsp;
Flipp&mdash;spelled Philip&mdash;Tweetel arrived in due course of
time at 23, Crane Court, ostensibly to take up the position of
<i>Good Humour&rsquo;s</i> office-boy; in reality, and without
his being aware of it, to act as its literary taster.&nbsp;
Stories in which Flipp became absorbed were accepted.&nbsp; Peter
groaned, but contented himself with correcting only their grosser
grammatical blunders; the experiment should be tried in all good
faith.&nbsp; Humour at which Flipp laughed was printed.&nbsp;
Peter tried to ease his conscience by increasing his subscription
to the fund for destitute compositors, but only partially
succeeded.&nbsp; Poetry that brought a tear to the eye of Flipp
was given leaded type.&nbsp; People of taste and judgment said
<i>Good Humour</i> had disappointed them.&nbsp; Its circulation,
slowly but steadily, increased.</p>
<p>&ldquo;See!&rdquo; cried the delighted Clodd; &ldquo;told you
so!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s sad to think&mdash;&rdquo; began Peter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Always is,&rdquo; interrupted Clodd cheerfully.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Moral&mdash;don&rsquo;t think too much.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell you what we&rsquo;ll do,&rdquo; added Clodd.&nbsp;
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll make a fortune out of this paper.&nbsp; Then
when we can afford to lose a little money, we&rsquo;ll launch a
paper that shall appeal only to the intellectual portion of the
public.&nbsp; Meanwhile&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>A squat black bottle with a label attached, standing on the
desk, arrested Clodd&rsquo;s attention.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When did this come?&rdquo; asked Clodd.</p>
<p>&ldquo;About an hour ago,&rdquo; Peter told him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Any order with it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think so.&rdquo;&nbsp; Peter searched for and found a
letter addressed to &ldquo;William Clodd, Esq., Advertising
Manager, <i>Good Humour</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; Clodd tore it open,
hastily devoured it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not closed up yet, are you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, not till eight o&rsquo;clock.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good!&nbsp; I want you to write me a par.&nbsp; Do it
now, then you won&rsquo;t forget it.&nbsp; For the &lsquo;Walnuts
and Wine&rsquo; column.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Peter sat down, headed a sheet of paper: &lsquo;For W. and W.
Col.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; questioned
Peter&mdash;&ldquo;something to drink?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a sort of port,&rdquo; explained Clodd,
&ldquo;that doesn&rsquo;t get into your head.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You consider that an advantage?&rdquo; queried
Peter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course.&nbsp; You can drink more of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Peter continued to write: &lsquo;Possesses all the qualities
of an old vintage port, without those deleterious
properties&mdash;&rsquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t tasted it,
Clodd,&rdquo; hinted Peter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all right&mdash;I have.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And was it good?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Splendid stuff.&nbsp; Say it&rsquo;s &lsquo;delicious
and invigorating.&rsquo;&nbsp; They&rsquo;ll be sure to quote
that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Peter wrote on: &lsquo;Personally I have found it delicious
and&mdash;&rsquo; Peter left off writing.&nbsp; &ldquo;I really
think, Clodd, I ought to taste it.&nbsp; You see, I am personally
recommending it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Finish that par.&nbsp; Let me have it to take round to
the printers.&nbsp; Then put the bottle in your pocket.&nbsp;
Take it home and make a night of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Clodd appeared to be in a mighty hurry.&nbsp; Now, this made
Peter only the more suspicious.&nbsp; The bottle was close to his
hand.&nbsp; Clodd tried to intercept him, but was not quick
enough.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re not used to temperance drinks,&rdquo;
urged Clodd.&nbsp; &ldquo;Your palate is not accustomed to
them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can tell whether it&rsquo;s &lsquo;delicious&rsquo;
or not, surely?&rdquo; pleaded Peter, who had pulled out the
cork.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a quarter-page advertisement for thirteen
weeks.&nbsp; Put it down and don&rsquo;t be a fool!&rdquo; urged
Clodd.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to put it down,&rdquo; laughed Peter,
who was fond of his joke.&nbsp; Peter poured out half a
tumblerful, and drank&mdash;some of it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Like it?&rdquo; demanded Clodd, with a savage grin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are sure&mdash;you are sure it was the right
bottle?&rdquo; gasped Peter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bottle&rsquo;s all right,&rdquo; Clodd assured
him.&nbsp; &ldquo;Try some more.&nbsp; Judge it
fairly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Peter ventured on another sip.&nbsp; &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t
think they would be satisfied if I recommended it as a
medicine?&rdquo; insinuated Peter&mdash;&ldquo;something to have
about the house in case of accidental poisoning?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Better go round and suggest the idea to them
yourself.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve done with it.&rdquo;&nbsp; Clodd took
up his hat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry&mdash;I&rsquo;m very sorry,&rdquo;
sighed Peter.&nbsp; &ldquo;But I couldn&rsquo;t
conscientiously&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Clodd put down his hat again with a bang.&nbsp; &ldquo;Oh!
confound that conscience of yours!&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t it ever
think of your creditors?&nbsp; What&rsquo;s the use of my working
out my lungs for you, when all you do is to hamper me at every
step?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wouldn&rsquo;t it be better policy,&rdquo; urged Peter,
&ldquo;to go for the better class of advertiser, who
doesn&rsquo;t ask you for this sort of thing?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go for him!&rdquo; snorted Clodd.&nbsp; &ldquo;Do you
think I don&rsquo;t go for him?&nbsp; They are just sheep.&nbsp;
Get one, you get the lot.&nbsp; Until you&rsquo;ve got the one,
the others won&rsquo;t listen to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s true,&rdquo; mused Peter.&nbsp; &ldquo;I
spoke to Wilkinson, of Kingsley&rsquo;s, myself.&nbsp; He advised
me to try and get Landor&rsquo;s.&nbsp; He thought that if I
could get an advertisement out of Landor, he might persuade his
people to give us theirs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And if you had gone to Landor, he would have promised
you theirs provided you got Kingsley&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They will come,&rdquo; thought hopeful Peter.&nbsp;
&ldquo;We are going up steadily.&nbsp; They will come with a
rush.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They had better come soon,&rdquo; thought Clodd.&nbsp;
&ldquo;The only things coming with a rush just now are
bills.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Those articles of young McTear&rsquo;s attracted a good
deal of attention,&rdquo; expounded Peter.&nbsp; &ldquo;He has
promised to write me another series.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jowett is the one to get hold of,&rdquo; mused
Clodd.&nbsp; &ldquo;Jowett, all the others follow like a flock of
geese waddling after the old gander.&nbsp; If only we could get
hold of Jowett, the rest would be easy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jowett was the proprietor of the famous Marble Soap.&nbsp;
Jowett spent on advertising every year a quarter of a million, it
was said.&nbsp; Jowett was the stay and prop of periodical
literature.&nbsp; New papers that secured the Marble Soap
advertisement lived and prospered; the new paper to which it was
denied languished and died.&nbsp; Jowett, and how to get hold of
him; Jowett, and how to get round him, formed the chief topic of
discussion at the council-board of most new papers, <i>Good
Humour</i> amongst the number.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have heard,&rdquo; said Miss Ramsbotham, who wrote
the Letter to Clorinda that filled each week the last two pages
of <i>Good Humour</i>, and that told Clorinda, who lived secluded
in the country, the daily history of the highest class society,
among whom Miss Ramsbotham appeared to live and have her being;
who they were, and what they wore, the wise and otherwise things
they did&mdash;&ldquo;I have heard,&rdquo; said Miss Ramsbotham
one morning, Jowett being as usual the subject under debate,
&ldquo;that the old man is susceptible to female
influence.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What I have always thought,&rdquo; said Clodd.&nbsp;
&ldquo;A lady advertising-agent might do well.&nbsp; At all
events, they couldn&rsquo;t kick her out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They might in the end,&rdquo; thought Peter.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Female door-porters would become a profession for muscular
ladies if ever the idea took root.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The first one would get a good start, anyhow,&rdquo;
thought Clodd.</p>
<p>The sub-editor had pricked up her ears.&nbsp; Once upon a
time, long ago, the sub-editor had succeeded, when all other
London journalists had failed, in securing an interview with a
certain great statesman.&nbsp; The sub-editor had never forgotten
this&mdash;nor allowed anyone else to forget it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I believe I could get it for you,&rdquo; said the
sub-editor.</p>
<p>The editor and the business-manager both spoke together.&nbsp;
They spoke with decision and with emphasis.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo; said the sub-editor.&nbsp; &ldquo;When
nobody else could get at him, it was I who interviewed
Prince&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve heard all about that,&rdquo; interrupted
the business-manager.&nbsp; &ldquo;If I had been your father at
the time, you would never have done it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How could I have stopped her?&rdquo; retorted Peter
Hope.&nbsp; &ldquo;She never said a word to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You could have kept an eye on her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Kept an eye on her!&nbsp; When you&rsquo;ve got a girl
of your own, you&rsquo;ll know more about them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When I have,&rdquo; asserted Clodd, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll
manage her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We know all about bachelor&rsquo;s children,&rdquo;
sneered Peter Hope, the editor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You leave it to me.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll have it for you
before the end of the week,&rdquo; crowed the sub-editor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you do get it,&rdquo; returned Clodd, &ldquo;I shall
throw it out, that&rsquo;s all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You said yourself a lady advertising-agent would be a
good idea,&rdquo; the sub-editor reminded him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So she might be,&rdquo; returned Clodd; &ldquo;but she
isn&rsquo;t going to be you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because she isn&rsquo;t, that&rsquo;s why.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But if&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;See you at the printer&rsquo;s at twelve,&rdquo; said
Clodd to Peter, and went out suddenly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I think he&rsquo;s an idiot,&rdquo; said the
sub-editor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do not often,&rdquo; said the editor, &ldquo;but on
this point I agree with him.&nbsp; Cadging for advertisements
isn&rsquo;t a woman&rsquo;s work.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But what is the difference between&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All the difference in the world,&rdquo; thought the
editor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t know what I was going to say,&rdquo;
returned his sub.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know the drift of it,&rdquo; asserted the editor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you let me&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know I do&mdash;a good deal too much.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m
going to turn over a new leaf.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All I propose to do&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whatever it is, you&rsquo;re not going to do it,&rdquo;
declared the chief.&nbsp; &ldquo;Shall be back at half-past
twelve, if anybody comes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It seems to me&mdash;&rdquo;&nbsp; But Peter was
gone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just like them all,&rdquo; wailed the sub-editor.&nbsp;
&ldquo;They can&rsquo;t argue; when you explain things to them,
they go out.&nbsp; It does make me so mad!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Miss Ramsbotham laughed.&nbsp; &ldquo;You are a downtrodden
little girl, Tommy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As if I couldn&rsquo;t take care of
myself!&rdquo;&nbsp; Tommy&rsquo;s chin was high up in the
air.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cheer up,&rdquo; suggested Miss Ramsbotham.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Nobody ever tells me not to do anything.&nbsp; I would
change with you if I could.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d have walked into that office and have had
that advertisement out of old Jowett in five minutes, I know I
would,&rdquo; bragged Tommy.&nbsp; &ldquo;I can always get on
with old men.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only with the old ones?&rdquo; queried Miss
Ramsbotham.</p>
<p>The door opened.&nbsp; &ldquo;Anybody in?&rdquo; asked the
face of Johnny Bulstrode, appearing in the jar.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t you see they are?&rdquo; snapped Tommy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Figure of speech,&rdquo; explained Johnny Bulstrode,
commonly called &ldquo;the Babe,&rdquo; entering and closing the
door behind him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you want?&rdquo; demanded the sub-editor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing in particular,&rdquo; replied the Babe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wrong time of the day to come for it, half-past eleven
in the morning,&rdquo; explained the sub-editor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter with you?&rdquo; asked the
Babe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Feeling very cross,&rdquo; confessed the
sub-editor.</p>
<p>The childlike face of the Babe expressed sympathetic
inquiry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are very indignant,&rdquo; explained Miss
Ramsbotham, &ldquo;because we are not allowed to rush off to
Cannon Street and coax an advertisement out of old Jowett, the
soap man.&nbsp; We feel sure that if we only put on our best hat,
he couldn&rsquo;t possibly refuse us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No coaxing required,&rdquo; thought the
sub-editor.&nbsp; &ldquo;Once get in to see the old fellow and
put the actual figures before him, he would clamour to come
in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Won&rsquo;t he see Clodd?&rdquo; asked the Babe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Won&rsquo;t see anybody on behalf of anything new just
at present, apparently,&rdquo; answered Miss Ramsbotham.&nbsp;
&ldquo;It was my fault.&nbsp; I was foolish enough to repeat that
I had heard he was susceptible to female charm.&nbsp; They say it
was Mrs. Sarkitt that got the advertisement for <i>The Lamp</i>
out of him.&nbsp; But, of course, it may not be true.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wish I was a soap man and had got advertisements to
give away,&rdquo; sighed the Babe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wish you were,&rdquo; agreed the sub-editor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You should have them all, Tommy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My name,&rdquo; corrected him the sub-editor, &ldquo;is
Miss Hope.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I beg your pardon,&rdquo; said the Babe.&nbsp; &ldquo;I
don&rsquo;t know how it is, but one gets into the way of calling
you Tommy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will thank you,&rdquo; said the sub-editor, &ldquo;to
get out of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am sorry,&rdquo; said the Babe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t let it occur again,&rdquo; said the
sub-editor.</p>
<p>The Babe stood first on one leg and then on the other, but
nothing seemed to come of it.&nbsp; &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said the
Babe, &ldquo;I just looked in, that&rsquo;s all.&nbsp; Nothing I
can do for you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing,&rdquo; thanked him the sub-editor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good morning,&rdquo; said the Babe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good morning,&rdquo; said the sub-editor.</p>
<p>The childlike face of the Babe wore a chastened expression as
it slowly descended the stairs.&nbsp; Most of the members of the
Autolycus Club looked in about once a day to see if they could do
anything for Tommy.&nbsp; Some of them had luck.&nbsp; Only the
day before, Porson&mdash;a heavy, most uninteresting
man&mdash;had been sent down all the way to Plaistow to inquire
after the wounded hand of a machine-boy.&nbsp; Young Alexander,
whose poetry some people could not even understand, had been
commissioned to search London for a second-hand edition of
Maitland&rsquo;s <i>Architecture</i>.&nbsp; Since a fortnight
nearly now, when he had been sent out to drive away an organ that
would not go, Johnny had been given nothing.</p>
<p>Johnny turned the corner into Fleet Street feeling bitter with
his lot.&nbsp; A boy carrying a parcel stumbled against him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Beg yer pardon&mdash;&rdquo; the small boy looked up
into Johnny&rsquo;s face, &ldquo;miss,&rdquo; added the small
boy, dodging the blow and disappearing into the crowd.</p>
<p>The Babe, by reason of his childlike face, was accustomed to
insults of this character, but to-day it especially irritated
him.&nbsp; Why at twenty-two could he not grow even a
moustache?&nbsp; Why was he only five feet five and a half?&nbsp;
Why had Fate cursed him with a pink-and-white complexion, so that
the members of his own club had nicknamed him &ldquo;the
Babe,&rdquo; while street-boys as they passed pleaded with him
for a kiss?&nbsp; Why was his very voice, a flute-like alto, more
suitable&mdash;Suddenly an idea sprang to life within his
brain.&nbsp; The idea grew.&nbsp; Passing a barber&rsquo;s shop,
Johnny went in.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Air cut, sir?&rdquo; remarked the barber,
fitting a sheet round Johnny&rsquo;s neck.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, shave,&rdquo; corrected Johnny.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Beg pardon,&rdquo; said the barber, substituting a
towel for the sheet.&nbsp; &ldquo;Do you shave up, sir?&rdquo;
later demanded the barber.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; answered Johnny.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pleasant weather we are having,&rdquo; said the
barber.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very,&rdquo; assented Johnny.</p>
<p>From the barber&rsquo;s, Johnny went to Stinchcombe&rsquo;s,
the costumier&rsquo;s, in Drury Lane.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am playing in a burlesque,&rdquo; explained the
Babe.&nbsp; &ldquo;I want you to rig me out completely as a
modern girl.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Peeth o&rsquo; luck!&rdquo; said the shopman.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Goth the very bundle for you.&nbsp; Juth come
in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall want everything,&rdquo; explained the Babe,
&ldquo;from the boots to the hat; stays, petticoats&mdash;the
whole bag of tricks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Regular troutheau there,&rdquo; said the shopman,
emptying out the canvas bag upon the counter.&nbsp; &ldquo;Thry
&rsquo;em on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Babe contented himself with trying on the costume and the
boots.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Juth made for you!&rdquo; said the shopman.</p>
<p>A little loose about the chest, suggested the Babe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thath&rsquo;s all right,&rdquo; said the shopman.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Couple o&rsquo; thmall towelths, all thath&rsquo;s
wanted.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t think it too showy?&rdquo; queried the
Babe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thowy?&nbsp; Sthylish, thath&rsquo;s all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are sure everything&rsquo;s here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Everythinkth there.&nbsp; &lsquo;Thept the bit o&rsquo;
meat inthide,&rdquo; assured him the shopman.</p>
<p>The Babe left a deposit, and gave his name and address.&nbsp;
The shopman promised the things should be sent round within an
hour.&nbsp; The Babe, who had entered into the spirit of the
thing, bought a pair of gloves and a small reticule, and made his
way to Bow Street.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want a woman&rsquo;s light brown wig,&rdquo; said the
Babe to Mr. Cox, the perruquier.</p>
<p>Mr. Cox tried on two.&nbsp; The deceptive appearance of the
second Mr. Cox pronounced as perfect.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Looks more natural on you than your own hair, blessed
if it doesn&rsquo;t!&rdquo; said Mr. Cox.</p>
<p>The wig also was promised within the hour.&nbsp; The spirit of
completeness descended upon the Babe.&nbsp; On his way back to
his lodgings in Great Queen Street, he purchased a ladylike
umbrella and a veil.</p>
<p>Now, a quarter of an hour after Johnny Bulstrode had made his
exit by the door of Mr. Stinchcombe&rsquo;s shop, one, Harry
Bennett, actor and member of the Autolycus Club, pushed it open
and entered.&nbsp; The shop was empty.&nbsp; Harry Bennett
hammered with his stick and waited.&nbsp; A piled-up bundle of
clothes lay upon the counter; a sheet of paper, with a name and
address scrawled across it, rested on the bundle.&nbsp; Harry
Bennett, given to idle curiosity, approached and read the
same.&nbsp; Harry Bennett, with his stick, poked the bundle,
scattering its items over the counter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Donth do thath!&rdquo; said the shopman, coming
up.&nbsp; &ldquo;Juth been putting &rsquo;em together.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What the devil,&rdquo; said Harry Bennett, &ldquo;is
Johnny Bulstrode going to do with that rig-out?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How thoud I know?&rdquo; answered the shopman.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Private theathricals, I suppoth.&nbsp; Friend o&rsquo;
yourth?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied Harry Bennett.&nbsp; &ldquo;By
Jove! he ought to make a good girl.&nbsp; Should like to see
it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well arthk him for a ticket.&nbsp; Donth make &rsquo;em
dirty,&rdquo; suggested the shopman.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I must,&rdquo; said Harry Bennett, and talked about his
own affairs.</p>
<p>The rig-out and the wig did not arrive at Johnny&rsquo;s
lodgings within the hour as promised, but arrived there within
three hours, which was as much as Johnny had expected.&nbsp; It
took Johnny nearly an hour to dress, but at last he stood before
the plate-glass panel of the wardrobe transformed.&nbsp; Johnny
had reason to be pleased with the result.&nbsp; A tall, handsome
girl looked back at him out of the glass&mdash;a little showily
dressed, perhaps, but decidedly <i>chic</i>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wonder if I ought to have a cloak,&rdquo; mused Johnny,
as a ray of sunshine, streaming through the window, fell upon the
image in the glass.&nbsp; &ldquo;Well, anyhow, I
haven&rsquo;t,&rdquo; thought Johnny, as the sunlight died away
again, &ldquo;so it&rsquo;s no good thinking about it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Johnny seized his reticule and his umbrella and opened
cautiously the door.&nbsp; Outside all was silent.&nbsp; Johnny
stealthily descended; in the passage paused again.&nbsp; Voices
sounded from the basement.&nbsp; Feeling like an escaped burglar,
Johnny slipped the latch of the big door and peeped out.&nbsp; A
policeman, pasting, turned and looked at him.&nbsp; Johnny
hastily drew back and closed the door again.&nbsp; Somebody was
ascending from the kitchen.&nbsp; Johnny, caught between two
terrors, nearer to the front door than to the stairs, having no
time, chose the street.&nbsp; It seemed to Johnny that the street
was making for him.&nbsp; A woman came hurriedly towards
him.&nbsp; What was she going to say to him?&nbsp; What should he
answer her?&nbsp; To his surprise she passed him, hardly noticing
him.&nbsp; Wondering what miracle had saved him, he took a few
steps forward.&nbsp; A couple of young clerks coming up from
behind turned to look at him, but on encountering his answering
stare of angry alarm, appeared confused and went their way.&nbsp;
It began to dawn upon him that mankind was less discerning than
he had feared.&nbsp; Gaining courage as he proceeded, he reached
Holborn.&nbsp; Here the larger crowd swept around him
indifferent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I beg your pardon,&rdquo; said Johnny, coming into
collision with a stout gentleman.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My fault,&rdquo; replied the stout gentleman, as,
smiling, he picked up his damaged hat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I beg your pardon,&rdquo; repeated Johnny again two
minutes later, colliding with a tall young lady.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Should advise you to take something for that squint of
yours,&rdquo; remarked the tall young lady with severity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter with me?&rdquo; thought
Johnny.&nbsp; &ldquo;Seems to be a sort of
mist&mdash;&rdquo;&nbsp; The explanation flashed across
him.&nbsp; &ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; said Johnny to himself,
&ldquo;it&rsquo;s this confounded veil!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Johnny decided to walk to the Marble Soap offices.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be more used to the hang of things by the time
I get there if I walk,&rdquo; thought Johnny.&nbsp; &ldquo;Hope
the old beggar&rsquo;s in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In Newgate Street, Johnny paused and pressed his hands against
his chest.&nbsp; &ldquo;Funny sort of pain I&rsquo;ve got,&rdquo;
thought Johnny.&nbsp; &ldquo;Wonder if I should shock them if I
went in somewhere for a drop of brandy?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It don&rsquo;t get any better,&rdquo; reflected Johnny,
with some alarm, on reaching the corner of Cheapside.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Hope I&rsquo;m not going to be ill.&nbsp;
Whatever&mdash;&rdquo;&nbsp; The explanation came to him.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Of course, it&rsquo;s these damned stays!&nbsp; No wonder
girls are short-tempered, at times.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At the offices of the Marble Soap, Johnny was treated with
marked courtesy.&nbsp; Mr. Jowett was out, was not expected back
till five o&rsquo;clock.&nbsp; Would the lady wait, or would she
call again?&nbsp; The lady decided, now she was there, to
wait.&nbsp; Would the lady take the easy-chair?&nbsp; Would the
lady have the window open or would she have it shut?&nbsp; Had
the lady seen <i>The Times</i>?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Or the <i>Ha&rsquo;penny Joker</i>?&rdquo; suggested a
junior clerk, who thereupon was promptly sent back to his
work.</p>
<p>Many of the senior clerks had occasion to pass through the
waiting-room.&nbsp; Two of the senior clerks held views about the
weather which they appeared wishful to express at length.&nbsp;
Johnny began to enjoy himself.&nbsp; This thing was going to be
good fun.&nbsp; By the time the slamming of doors and the
hurrying of feet announced the advent of the chief, Johnny was
looking forward to his interview.</p>
<p>It was briefer and less satisfactory than he had
anticipated.&nbsp; Mr. Jowett was very busy&mdash;did not as a
rule see anybody in the afternoon; but of course, a
lady&mdash;&ldquo;Would Miss&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Montgomery.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Would Miss Montgomery inform Mr. Jowett what it was he
might have the pleasure of doing for her?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Miss Montgomery explained.</p>
<p>Mr. Jowett seemed half angry, half amused.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Really,&rdquo; said Mr. Jowett, &ldquo;this is hardly
playing the game.&nbsp; Against our fellow-men we can protect
ourselves, but if the ladies are going to attack us&mdash;really
it isn&rsquo;t fair.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Miss Montgomery pleaded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll think it over,&rdquo; was all that Mr.
Jowett could be made to promise.&nbsp; &ldquo;Look me up
again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When?&rdquo; asked Miss Montgomery.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s to-day?&mdash;Thursday.&nbsp; Say
Monday.&rdquo;&nbsp; Mr. Jowett rang the bell.&nbsp; &ldquo;Take
my advice,&rdquo; said the old gentleman, laying a fatherly hand
on Johnny&rsquo;s shoulder, &ldquo;leave business to us
men.&nbsp; You are a handsome girl.&nbsp; You can do better for
yourself than this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A clerk entered, Johnny rose.</p>
<p>&ldquo;On Monday next, then,&rdquo; Johnny reminded him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At four o&rsquo;clock,&rdquo; agreed Mr. Jowett.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Good afternoon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Johnny went out feeling disappointed, and yet, as he told
himself, he hadn&rsquo;t done so badly.&nbsp; Anyhow, there was
nothing for it but to wait till Monday.&nbsp; Now he would go
home, change his clothes, and get some dinner.&nbsp; He hailed a
hansom.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Number twenty-eight&mdash;no.&nbsp; Stop at the
Queen&rsquo;s Street corner of Lincoln&rsquo;s Inn Fields,&rdquo;
Johnny directed the man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quite right, miss,&rdquo; commented the cabman
pleasantly.&nbsp; &ldquo;Corner&rsquo;s best&mdash;saves all
talk.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; demanded Johnny.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No offence, miss,&rdquo; answered the man.&nbsp;
&ldquo;We was all young once.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Johnny climbed in.&nbsp; At the corner of Queen Street and
Lincoln&rsquo;s Inn Fields, Johnny got out.&nbsp; Johnny, who had
been pondering other matters, put his hand instinctively to
where, speaking generally, his pocket should have been; then
recollected himself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let me see, did I think to bring any money out with me,
or did I not?&rdquo; mused Johnny, as he stood upon the kerb.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look in the ridicule, miss,&rdquo; suggested the
cabman.</p>
<p>Johnny looked.&nbsp; It was empty.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps I put it in my pocket,&rdquo; thought
Johnny.</p>
<p>The cabman hitched his reins to the whip-socket and leant
back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s somewhere about here, I know, I saw
it,&rdquo; Johnny told himself.&nbsp; &ldquo;Sorry to keep you
waiting,&rdquo; Johnny added aloud to the cabman.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you worry about that, miss,&rdquo; replied
the cabman civilly; &ldquo;we are used to it.&nbsp; A shilling a
quarter of an hour is what we charge.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of all the damned silly tricks!&rdquo; muttered Johnny
to himself.</p>
<p>Two small boys and a girl carrying a baby paused,
interested.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go away,&rdquo; told them the cabman.&nbsp;
&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll have troubles of your own one day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The urchins moved a few steps further, then halted again and
were joined by a slatternly woman and another boy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Got it!&rdquo; cried Johnny, unable to suppress his
delight as his hand slipped through a fold.&nbsp; The lady with
the baby, without precisely knowing why, set up a shrill
cheer.&nbsp; Johnny&rsquo;s delight died away; it wasn&rsquo;t
the pocket-hole.&nbsp; Short of taking the skirt off and turning
it inside out, it didn&rsquo;t seem to Johnny that he ever would
find that pocket.</p>
<p>Then in that moment of despair he came across it
accidentally.&nbsp; It was as empty as the reticule!</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am sorry,&rdquo; said Johnny to the cabman,
&ldquo;but I appear to have come out without my purse.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The cabman said he had heard that tale before, and was making
preparations to descend.&nbsp; The crowd, now numbering eleven,
looked hopeful.&nbsp; It occurred to Johnny later that he might
have offered his umbrella to the cabman; at least it would have
fetched the eighteenpence.&nbsp; One thinks of these things
afterwards.&nbsp; The only idea that occurred to him at the
moment was that of getting home.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Ere, &rsquo;old my &rsquo;orse a minute, one of
yer,&rdquo; shouted the cabman.</p>
<p>Half a dozen willing hands seized the dozing steed and roused
it into madness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hi! stop &rsquo;er!&rdquo; roared the cabman.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s down!&rdquo; shouted the excited crowd.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tripped over &rsquo;er skirt,&rdquo; explained the
slatternly woman.&nbsp; &ldquo;They do &rsquo;amper
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, she&rsquo;s not.&nbsp; She&rsquo;s up again!&rdquo;
vociferated a delighted plumber, with a sounding slap on his own
leg.&nbsp; &ldquo;Gor blimy, if she ain&rsquo;t a good
&rsquo;un!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Fortunately the Square was tolerably clear and Johnny a good
runner.&nbsp; Holding now his skirt and petticoat high in his
left hand, Johnny moved across the Square at the rate of fifteen
miles an hour.&nbsp; A butcher&rsquo;s boy sprang in front of him
with arms held out to stop him.&nbsp; The thing that for the next
three months annoyed that butcher boy most was hearing shouted
out after him &ldquo;Yah! who was knocked down and run over by a
lidy?&rdquo;&nbsp; By the time Johnny reached the Strand,
<i>vi&acirc;</i> Clement&rsquo;s Inn, the hue and cry was far
behind.&nbsp; Johnny dropped his skirts and assumed a more
girlish pace.&nbsp; Through Bow Street and Long Acre he reached
Great Queen Street in safety.&nbsp; Upon his own doorstep he
began to laugh.&nbsp; His afternoon&rsquo;s experience had been
amusing; still, on the whole, he wasn&rsquo;t sorry it was
over.&nbsp; One can have too much even of the best of
jokes.&nbsp; Johnny rang the bell.</p>
<p>The door opened.&nbsp; Johnny would have walked in had not a
big, raw-boned woman barred his progress.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you want?&rdquo; demanded the raw-boned
woman.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Want to come in,&rdquo; explained Johnny.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you want to come in for?&rdquo;</p>
<p>This appeared to Johnny a foolish question.&nbsp; On
reflection he saw the sense of it.&nbsp; This raw-boned woman was
not Mrs. Pegg, his landlady.&nbsp; Some friend of hers, he
supposed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all right,&rdquo; said Johnny, &ldquo;I live
here.&nbsp; Left my latchkey at home, that&rsquo;s
all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no females lodging here,&rdquo; declared
the raw-boned lady.&nbsp; &ldquo;And what&rsquo;s more,
there&rsquo;s going to be none.&rdquo;</p>
<p>All this was very vexing.&nbsp; Johnny, in his joy at reaching
his own doorstep, had not foreseen these complications.&nbsp; Now
it would be necessary to explain things.&nbsp; He only hoped the
story would not get round to the fellows at the club.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ask Mrs. Pegg to step up for a minute,&rdquo; requested
Johnny.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not at &rsquo;ome,&rdquo; explained the raw-boned
lady.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not&mdash;not at home?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gone to Romford, if you wish to know, to see her
mother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gone to Romford?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I said Romford, didn&rsquo;t I?&rdquo; retorted the
raw-boned lady, tartly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&mdash;what time do you expect her in?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sunday evening, six o&rsquo;clock,&rdquo; replied the
raw-boned lady.</p>
<p>Johnny looked at the raw-boned lady, imagined himself telling
the raw-boned lady the simple, unvarnished truth, and the
raw-boned lady&rsquo;s utter disbelief of every word of it.&nbsp;
An inspiration came to his aid.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am Mr. Bulstrode&rsquo;s sister,&rdquo; said Johnny
meekly; &ldquo;he&rsquo;s expecting me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thought you said you lived here?&rdquo; reminded him
the raw-boned lady.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I meant that he lived here,&rdquo; replied poor Johnny
still more meekly.&nbsp; &ldquo;He has the second floor, you
know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know,&rdquo; replied the raw-boned lady.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Not in just at present.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not in?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Went out at three o&rsquo;clock.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go up to his room and wait for him,&rdquo;
said Johnny.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, you won&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said the raw-boned
lady.</p>
<p>For an instant it occurred to Johnny to make a dash for it,
but the raw-boned lady looked both formidable and
determined.&nbsp; There would be a big disturbance&mdash;perhaps
the police called in.&nbsp; Johnny had often wanted to see his
name in print: in connection with this affair he somehow felt he
didn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do let me in,&rdquo; Johnny pleaded; &ldquo;I have
nowhere else to go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have a walk and cool yourself,&rdquo; suggested the
raw-boned lady.&nbsp; &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t expect he will be
long.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, you see&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The raw-boned lady slammed the door.</p>
<p>Outside a restaurant in Wellington Street, from which
proceeded savoury odours, Johnny paused and tried to think.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What the devil did I do with that umbrella?&nbsp; I had
it&mdash;no, I didn&rsquo;t.&nbsp; Must have dropped it, I
suppose, when that silly ass tried to stop me.&nbsp; By Jove! I
am having luck!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Outside another restaurant in the Strand Johnny paused
again.&nbsp; &ldquo;How am I to live till Sunday night?&nbsp;
Where am I to sleep?&nbsp; If I telegraph home&mdash;damn it! how
can I telegraph?&nbsp; I haven&rsquo;t got a penny.&nbsp; This is
funny,&rdquo; said Johnny, unconsciously speaking aloud;
&ldquo;upon my word, this is funny!&nbsp; Oh! you go
to&mdash;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Johnny hurled this last at the head of an overgrown errand-boy
whose intention had been to offer sympathy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I never!&rdquo; commented a passing
flower-girl.&nbsp; &ldquo;Calls &rsquo;erself a lidy, I
suppose.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nowadays,&rdquo; observed the stud and button merchant
at the corner of Exeter Street, &ldquo;they make &rsquo;em out of
anything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Drawn by a notion that was forming in his mind, Johnny turned
his steps up Bedford Street.&nbsp; &ldquo;Why not?&rdquo; mused
Johnny.&nbsp; &ldquo;Nobody else seems to have a suspicion.&nbsp;
Why should they?&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll never hear the last of it if
they find me out.&nbsp; But why should they find me out?&nbsp;
Well, something&rsquo;s got to be done.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Johnny walked on quickly.&nbsp; At the door of the Autolycus
Club he was undecided for a moment, then took his courage in both
hands and plunged through the swing doors.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is Mr. Herring&mdash;Mr. Jack
Herring&mdash;here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Find him in the smoking-room, Mr. Bulstrode,&rdquo;
answered old Goslin, who was reading the evening paper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, would you mind asking him to step out a
moment?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Old Goslin looked up, took off his spectacles, rubbed them,
put them on again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Please say Miss Bulstrode&mdash;Mr. Bulstrode&rsquo;s
sister.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Old Goslin found Jack Herring the centre of an earnest
argument on Hamlet&mdash;was he really mad?</p>
<p>&ldquo;A lady to see you, Mr. Herring,&rdquo; announced old
Goslin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A what?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Miss Bulstrode&mdash;Mr. Bulstrode&rsquo;s
sister.&nbsp; She&rsquo;s waiting in the hall.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never knew he had a sister,&rdquo; said Jack Herring,
rising.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait a minute,&rdquo; said Harry Bennett.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Shut that door.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t go.&rdquo;&nbsp; This to
old Goslin, who closed the door and returned.&nbsp; &ldquo;Lady
in a heliotrope dress with a lace collar, three flounces on the
skirt?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right, Mr. Bennett,&rdquo; agreed old
Goslin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the Babe himself!&rdquo; asserted Harry
Bennett.</p>
<p>The question of Hamlet&rsquo;s madness was forgotten.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Was in at Stinchcombe&rsquo;s this morning,&rdquo;
explained Harry Bennett; &ldquo;saw the clothes on the counter
addressed to him.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s the identical frock.&nbsp;
This is just a &lsquo;try on&rsquo;&mdash;thinks he&rsquo;s going
to have a lark with us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Autolycus Club looked round at itself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can see verra promising possibilities in this,
provided the thing is properly managed,&rdquo; said the Wee
Laddie, after a pause.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So can I,&rdquo; agreed Jack Herring.&nbsp; &ldquo;Keep
where you are, all of you.&nbsp; &rsquo;Twould be a pity to fool
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Autolycus Club waited.&nbsp; Jack Herring re-entered the
room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One of the saddest stories I have ever heard in all my
life,&rdquo; explained Jack Herring in a whisper.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Poor girl left Derbyshire this morning to come and see her
brother; found him out&mdash;hasn&rsquo;t been seen at his
lodgings since three o&rsquo;clock; fears something may have
happened to him.&nbsp; Landlady gone to Romford to see her
mother; strange woman in charge, won&rsquo;t let her in to wait
for him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How sad it is when trouble overtakes the innocent and
helpless!&rdquo; murmured Somerville the Briefless.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s not the worst of it,&rdquo; continued
Jack.&nbsp; &ldquo;The dear girl has been robbed of everything
she possesses, even of her umbrella, and hasn&rsquo;t got a
<i>sou</i>; hasn&rsquo;t had any dinner, and doesn&rsquo;t know
where to sleep.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sounds a bit elaborate,&rdquo; thought Porson.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think I can understand it,&rdquo; said the Briefless
one.&nbsp; &ldquo;What has happened is this.&nbsp; He&rsquo;s
dressed up thinking to have a bit of fun with us, and has come
out, forgetting to put any money or his latchkey in his
pocket.&nbsp; His landlady may have gone to Romford or may
not.&nbsp; In any case, he would have to knock at the door and
enter into explanations.&nbsp; What does he suggest&mdash;the
loan of a sovereign?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The loan of two,&rdquo; replied Jack Herring.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To buy himself a suit of clothes.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t you
do it, Jack.&nbsp; Providence has imposed this upon us.&nbsp; Our
duty is to show him the folly of indulging in senseless
escapades.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think we might give him a dinner,&rdquo; thought the
stout and sympathetic Porson.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What I propose to do,&rdquo; grinned Jack, &ldquo;is to
take him round to Mrs. Postwhistle&rsquo;s.&nbsp; She&rsquo;s
under a sort of obligation to me.&nbsp; It was I who got her the
post office.&nbsp; We&rsquo;ll leave him there for a night, with
instructions to Mrs. P. to keep a motherly eye on him.&nbsp;
To-morrow he shall have his &lsquo;bit of fun,&rsquo; and I guess
he&rsquo;ll be the first to get tired of the joke.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It looked a promising plot.&nbsp; Seven members of the
Autolycus Club gallantly undertook to accompany &ldquo;Miss
Bulstrode&rdquo; to her lodgings.&nbsp; Jack Herring excited
jealousy by securing the privilege of carrying her
reticule.&nbsp; &ldquo;Miss Bulstrode&rdquo; was given to
understand that anything any of the seven could do for her, each
and every would be delighted to do, if only for the sake of her
brother, one of the dearest boys that ever breathed&mdash;a bit
of an ass, though that, of course, he could not help.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Miss Bulstrode&rdquo; was not as grateful as perhaps she
should have been.&nbsp; Her idea still was that if one of them
would lend her a couple of sovereigns, the rest need not worry
themselves further.&nbsp; This, purely in her own interests, they
declined to do.&nbsp; She had suffered one extensive robbery that
day already, as Jack reminded her.&nbsp; London was a city of
danger to the young and inexperienced.&nbsp; Far better that they
should watch over her and provide for her simple wants.&nbsp;
Painful as it was to refuse a lady, a beloved companion&rsquo;s
sister&rsquo;s welfare was yet dearer to them.&nbsp; &ldquo;Miss
Bulstrode&rsquo;s&rdquo; only desire was not to waste their
time.&nbsp; Jack Herring&rsquo;s opinion was that there existed
no true Englishman who would grudge time spent upon succouring a
beautiful maiden in distress.</p>
<p>Arrived at the little grocer&rsquo;s shop in Rolls Court, Jack
Herring drew Mrs. Postwhistle aside.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s the sister of a very dear friend of
ours,&rdquo; explained Jack Herring.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A fine-looking girl,&rdquo; commented Mrs.
Postwhistle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall be round again in the morning.&nbsp;
Don&rsquo;t let her out of your sight, and, above all,
don&rsquo;t lend her any money,&rdquo; directed Jack Herring.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I understand,&rdquo; replied Mrs. Postwhistle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Miss Bulstrode&rdquo; having despatched an excellent
supper of cold mutton and bottled beer, leant back in her chair
and crossed her legs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have often wondered,&rdquo; remarked Miss Bulstrode,
her eyes fixed upon the ceiling, &ldquo;what a cigarette would
taste like.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Taste nasty, I should say, the first time,&rdquo;
thought Mrs. Postwhistle, who was knitting.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some girls, so I have heard,&rdquo; remarked Miss
Bulstrode, &ldquo;smoke cigarettes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not nice girls,&rdquo; thought Mrs. Postwhistle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One of the nicest girls I ever knew,&rdquo; remarked
Miss Bulstrode, &ldquo;always smoked a cigarette after
supper.&nbsp; Said it soothed her nerves.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wouldn&rsquo;t &rsquo;ave thought so if I&rsquo;d
&rsquo;ad charge of &rsquo;er,&rdquo; said Mrs. Postwhistle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think,&rdquo; said Miss Bulstrode, who seemed
restless, &ldquo;I think I shall go for a little walk before
turning in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps it would do us good,&rdquo; agreed Mrs.
Postwhistle, laying down her knitting.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you trouble to come,&rdquo; urged the
thoughtful Miss Bulstrode.&nbsp; &ldquo;You look
tired.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not at all,&rdquo; replied Mrs. Postwhistle.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Feel I should like it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In some respects Mrs. Postwhistle proved an admirable
companion.&nbsp; She asked no questions, and only spoke when
spoken to, which, during that walk, was not often.&nbsp; At the
end of half an hour, Miss Bulstrode pleaded a headache and
thought she would return home and go to bed.&nbsp; Mrs.
Postwhistle thought it a reasonable idea.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, it&rsquo;s better than tramping the
streets,&rdquo; muttered Johnny, as the bedroom door was closed
behind him, &ldquo;and that&rsquo;s all one can say for it.&nbsp;
Must get hold of a smoke to-morrow, if I have to rob the
till.&nbsp; What&rsquo;s that?&rdquo;&nbsp; Johnny stole across
on, tiptoe.&nbsp; &ldquo;Confound it!&rdquo; said Johnny,
&ldquo;if she hasn&rsquo;t locked the door!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Johnny sat down upon the bed and took stock of his
position.&nbsp; &ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t seem to me,&rdquo;
thought Johnny, &ldquo;that I&rsquo;m ever going to get out of
this mess.&rdquo;&nbsp; Johnny, still muttering, unfastened his
stays.&nbsp; &ldquo;Thank God, that&rsquo;s off!&rdquo;
ejaculated Johnny piously, as he watched his form slowly
expanding.&nbsp; &ldquo;Suppose I&rsquo;ll be used to them before
I&rsquo;ve finished with them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Johnny had a night of dreams.</p>
<p>For the whole of next day, which was Friday, Johnny remained
&ldquo;Miss Bulstrode,&rdquo; hoping against hope to find an
opportunity to escape from his predicament without
confession.&nbsp; The entire Autolycus Club appeared to have
fallen in love with him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thought I was a bit of a fool myself,&rdquo; mused
Johnny, &ldquo;where a petticoat was concerned.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t
believe these blithering idiots have ever seen a girl
before.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They came in ones, they came in little parties, and tendered
him devotion.&nbsp; Even Mrs. Postwhistle, accustomed to regard
human phenomena without comment, remarked upon it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When you are all tired of it,&rdquo; said Mrs.
Postwhistle to Jack Herring, &ldquo;let me know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The moment we find her brother,&rdquo; explained Jack
Herring, &ldquo;of course we shall take her to him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing like looking in the right place for a thing
when you&rsquo;ve finished looking in the others,&rdquo; observed
Mrs. Postwhistle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; demanded Jack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just what I say,&rdquo; answered Mrs. Postwhistle.</p>
<p>Jack Herring looked at Mrs. Postwhistle.&nbsp; But Mrs.
Postwhistle&rsquo;s face was not of the expressive order.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Post office still going strong?&rdquo; asked Jack
Herring.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The post office &rsquo;as been a great &rsquo;elp to
me,&rdquo; admitted Mrs. Postwhistle; &ldquo;and I&rsquo;m not
forgetting that I owe it to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t mention it,&rdquo; murmured Jack
Herring.</p>
<p>They brought her presents&mdash;nothing very expensive, more
as tokens of regard: dainty packets of sweets, nosegays of simple
flowers, bottles of scent.&nbsp; To Somerville &ldquo;Miss
Bulstrode&rdquo; hinted that if he really did desire to please
her, and wasn&rsquo;t merely talking through his hat&mdash;Miss
Bulstrode apologised for the slang, which, she feared, she must
have picked up from her brother&mdash;he might give her a box of
Messani&rsquo;s cigarettes, size No. 2.&nbsp; The suggestion
pained him.&nbsp; Somerville the Briefless was perhaps
old-fashioned.&nbsp; Miss Bulstrode cut him short by agreeing
that he was, and seemed disinclined for further conversation.</p>
<p>They took her to Madame Tussaud&rsquo;s.&nbsp; They took her
up the Monument.&nbsp; They took her to the Tower of
London.&nbsp; In the evening they took her to the Polytechnic to
see Pepper&rsquo;s Ghost.&nbsp; They made a merry party wherever
they went.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Seem to be enjoying themselves!&rdquo; remarked other
sightseers, surprised and envious.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Girl seems to be a bit out of it,&rdquo; remarked
others, more observant.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sulky-looking bit o&rsquo; goods, I call her,&rdquo;
remarked some of the ladies.</p>
<p>The fortitude with which Miss Bulstrode bore the mysterious
disappearance of her brother excited admiration.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hadn&rsquo;t we better telegraph to your people in
Derbyshire?&rdquo; suggested Jack Herring.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t do it,&rdquo; vehemently protested the
thoughtful Miss Bulstrode; &ldquo;it might alarm them.&nbsp; The
best plan is for you to lend me a couple of sovereigns and let me
return home quietly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You might be robbed again,&rdquo; feared Jack
Herring.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go down with you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps he&rsquo;ll turn up to-morrow,&rdquo; thought
Miss Bulstrode.&nbsp; &ldquo;Expect he&rsquo;s gone on a
visit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He ought not to have done it,&rdquo; thought Jack
Herring, &ldquo;knowing you were coming.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! he&rsquo;s like that,&rdquo; explained Miss
Bulstrode.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I had a young and beautiful sister&mdash;&rdquo;
said Jack Herring.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! let&rsquo;s talk of something else,&rdquo;
suggested Miss Bulstrode.&nbsp; &ldquo;You make me
tired.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With Jack Herring, in particular, Johnny was beginning to lose
patience.&nbsp; That &ldquo;Miss Bulstrode&rsquo;s&rdquo; charms
had evidently struck Jack Herring all of a heap, as the saying
is, had in the beginning amused Master Johnny.&nbsp;
Indeed&mdash;as in the seclusion of his bedchamber over the
little grocer&rsquo;s shop he told himself with bitter
self-reproach&mdash;he had undoubtedly encouraged the man.&nbsp;
From admiration Jack had rapidly passed to infatuation, from
infatuation to apparent imbecility.&nbsp; Had Johnny&rsquo;s mind
been less intent upon his own troubles, he might have been
suspicious.&nbsp; As it was, and after all that had happened,
nothing now could astonish Johnny.&nbsp; &ldquo;Thank
Heaven,&rdquo; murmured Johnny, as he blew out the light,
&ldquo;this Mrs. Postwhistle appears to be a reliable
woman.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now, about the same time that Johnny&rsquo;s head was falling
thus upon his pillow, the Autolycus Club sat discussing plans for
their next day&rsquo;s entertainment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think,&rdquo; said Jack Herring, &ldquo;the Crystal
Palace in the morning when it&rsquo;s nice and quiet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To be followed by Greenwich Hospital in the
afternoon,&rdquo; suggested Somerville.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Winding up with the Moore and Burgess Minstrels in the
evening,&rdquo; thought Porson.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hardly the place for the young person,&rdquo; feared
Jack Herring.&nbsp; &ldquo;Some of the jokes&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Brandram gives a reading of <i>Julius
C&aelig;sar</i> at St. George&rsquo;s Hall,&rdquo; the Wee Laddie
informed them for their guidance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hallo!&rdquo; said Alexander the Poet, entering at the
moment.&nbsp; &ldquo;What are you all talking about?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We were discussing where to take Miss Bulstrode
to-morrow evening,&rdquo; informed him Jack Herring.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Miss Bulstrode,&rdquo; repeated the Poet in a tone of
some surprise.&nbsp; &ldquo;Do you mean Johnny Bulstrode&rsquo;s
sister?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the lady,&rdquo; answered Jack.&nbsp;
&ldquo;But how do you come to know about her?&nbsp; Thought you
were in Yorkshire.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Came up yesterday,&rdquo; explained the Poet.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Travelled up with her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Travelled up with her?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;From Matlock Bath.&nbsp; What&rsquo;s the matter with
you all?&rdquo; demanded the Poet.&nbsp; &ldquo;You all of you
look&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sit down,&rdquo; said the Briefless one to the
Poet.&nbsp; &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s talk this matter over
quietly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Alexander the Poet, mystified, sat down.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You say you travelled up to London yesterday with Miss
Bulstrode.&nbsp; You are sure it was Miss Bulstrode?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure!&rdquo; retorted the Poet.&nbsp; &ldquo;Why,
I&rsquo;ve known her ever since she was a baby.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;About what time did you reach London?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Three-thirty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what became of her?&nbsp; Where did she say she was
going?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I never asked her.&nbsp; The last I saw of her she was
getting into a cab.&nbsp; I had an appointment myself, and
was&mdash;I say, what&rsquo;s the matter with Herring?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Herring had risen and was walking about with his head between
his hands.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never mind him.&nbsp; Miss Bulstrode is a lady of
about&mdash;how old?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Eighteen&mdash;no, nineteen last birthday.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A tall, handsome sort of girl?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&nbsp; I say, has anything happened to
her?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing has happened to her,&rdquo; assured him
Somerville.&nbsp; &ldquo;<i>She&rsquo;s</i> all right.&nbsp; Been
having rather a good time, on the whole.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Poet was relieved to hear it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I asked her an hour ago,&rdquo; said Jack Herring, who
was still holding his head between his hands as if to make sure
it was there, &ldquo;if she thought she could ever learn to love
me.&nbsp; Would you say that could be construed into an offer of
marriage?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The remainder of the Club was unanimously of opinion that,
practically speaking, it was a proposal.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see it,&rdquo; argued Jack Herring.&nbsp;
&ldquo;It was merely in the nature of a remark.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Club was of opinion that such quibbling was unworthy of a
gentleman.</p>
<p>It appeared to be a case for prompt action.&nbsp; Jack Herring
sat down and then and there began a letter to Miss Bulstrode,
care of Mrs. Postwhistle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But what I don&rsquo;t understand&mdash;&rdquo; said
Alexander the Poet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! take him away somewhere and tell him,
someone,&rdquo; moaned Jack Herring.&nbsp; &ldquo;How can I think
with all this chatter going on?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But why did Bennett&mdash;&rdquo; whispered Porson.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where is Bennett?&rdquo; demanded half a dozen fierce
voices.</p>
<p>Harry Bennett had not been seen all day.</p>
<p>Jack&rsquo;s letter was delivered to &ldquo;Miss
Bulstrode&rdquo; the next morning at breakfast-time.&nbsp; Having
perused it, Miss Bulstrode rose and requested of Mrs. Postwhistle
the loan of half a crown.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Herring&rsquo;s particular instructions
were,&rdquo; explained Mrs. Postwhistle, &ldquo;that, above all
things, I was not to lend you any money.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When you have read that,&rdquo; replied Miss Bulstrode,
handing her the letter, &ldquo;perhaps you will agree with me
that Herring is&mdash;an ass.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Postwhistle read the letter and produced the
half-crown.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Better get a shave with part of it,&rdquo; suggested
Mrs. Postwhistle.&nbsp; &ldquo;That is, if you are going to play
the fool much longer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Miss Bulstrode&rdquo; opened his eyes.&nbsp; Mrs.
Postwhistle went on with her breakfast.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t tell them,&rdquo; said Johnny; &ldquo;not
just for a little while, at all events.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing to do with me,&rdquo; replied Mrs.
Postwhistle.</p>
<p>Twenty minutes later, the real Miss Bulstrode, on a visit to
her aunt in Kensington, was surprised at receiving, enclosed in
an envelope, the following hastily scrawled note:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Want to speak to you at
once&mdash;<i>alone</i>.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t yell when you see
me.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s all right.&nbsp; Can explain in two
ticks.&mdash;Your loving brother, <span
class="smcap">Johnny</span>.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It took longer than two ticks; but at last the Babe came to an
end of it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When you have done laughing,&rdquo; said the Babe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you look so ridiculous,&rdquo; said his sister.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>They</i> didn&rsquo;t think so,&rdquo; retorted the
Babe.&nbsp; &ldquo;I took them in all right.&nbsp; Guess
you&rsquo;ve never had as much attention, all in one
day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you sure you took them in?&rdquo; queried his
sister.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you will come to the Club at eight o&rsquo;clock
this evening,&rdquo; said the Babe, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll prove it to
you.&nbsp; Perhaps I&rsquo;ll take you on to a theatre
afterwards&mdash;if you&rsquo;re good.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Babe himself walked into the Autolycus Club a few minutes
before eight and encountered an atmosphere of restraint.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thought you were lost,&rdquo; remarked Somerville
coldly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Called away suddenly&mdash;very important
business,&rdquo; explained the Babe.&nbsp; &ldquo;Awfully much
obliged to all you fellows for all you have been doing for my
sister.&nbsp; She&rsquo;s just been telling me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t mention it,&rdquo; said two or three.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Awfully good of you, I&rsquo;m sure,&rdquo; persisted
the Babe.&nbsp; &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t know what she would have done
without you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A mere nothing, the Club assured him.&nbsp; The blushing
modesty of the Autolycus Club at hearing of their own good deeds
was touching.&nbsp; Left to themselves, they would have talked of
quite other things.&nbsp; As a matter of fact, they tried to.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never heard her speak so enthusiastically of anyone as
she does of you, Jack,&rdquo; said the Babe, turning to Jack
Herring.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course, you know, dear boy,&rdquo; explained Jack
Herring, &ldquo;anything I could do for a sister of
yours&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know, dear boy,&rdquo; replied the Babe; &ldquo;I
always felt it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say no more about it,&rdquo; urged Jack Herring.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She couldn&rsquo;t quite make out that letter of yours
this morning,&rdquo; continued the Babe, ignoring Jack&rsquo;s
request.&nbsp; &ldquo;She&rsquo;s afraid you think her
ungrateful.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It seemed to me, on reflection,&rdquo; explained Jack
Herring, &ldquo;that on one or two little matters she may have
misunderstood me.&nbsp; As I wrote her, there are days when I
don&rsquo;t seem altogether to quite know what I&rsquo;m
doing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rather awkward,&rdquo; thought the Babe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is,&rdquo; agreed Jack Herring.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Yesterday was one of them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She tells me you were most kind to her,&rdquo; the Babe
reassured him.&nbsp; &ldquo;She thought at first it was a little
uncivil, your refusing to lend her any money.&nbsp; But as I put
it to her&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was silly of me,&rdquo; interrupted Jack.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I see that now.&nbsp; I went round this morning meaning to
make it all right.&nbsp; But she was gone, and Mrs. Postwhistle
seemed to think I had better leave things as they were.&nbsp; I
blame myself exceedingly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear boy, don&rsquo;t blame yourself for
anything.&nbsp; You acted nobly,&rdquo; the Babe told him.&nbsp;
&ldquo;She&rsquo;s coming here to call for me this evening on
purpose to thank you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d rather not,&rdquo; said Jack Herring.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nonsense,&rdquo; said the Babe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You must excuse me,&rdquo; insisted Jack Herring.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t mean it rudely, but really I&rsquo;d rather
not see her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But here she is,&rdquo; said the Babe, taking at that
moment the card from old Goslin&rsquo;s hand.&nbsp; &ldquo;She
will think it so strange.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d really rather not,&rdquo; repeated poor
Jack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It seems discourteous,&rdquo; suggested Somerville.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You go,&rdquo; suggested Jack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She doesn&rsquo;t want to see me,&rdquo; explained
Somerville.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes she does,&rdquo; corrected him the Babe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d forgotten, she wants to see you
both.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I go,&rdquo; said Jack, &ldquo;I shall tell her the
plain truth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you know,&rdquo; said Somerville, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
thinking that will be the shortest way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Miss Bulstrode was seated in the hall.&nbsp; Jack Herring and
Somerville both thought her present quieter style of dress suited
her much better.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here he is,&rdquo; announced the Babe, in
triumph.&nbsp; &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s Jack Herring and here&rsquo;s
Somerville.&nbsp; Do you know, I could hardly persuade them to
come out and see you.&nbsp; Dear old Jack, he always was so
shy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Miss Bulstrode rose.&nbsp; She said she could never thank them
sufficiently for all their goodness to her.&nbsp; Miss Bulstrode
seemed quite overcome.&nbsp; Her voice trembled with emotion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Before we go further, Miss Bulstrode,&rdquo; said Jack
Herring, &ldquo;it will be best to tell you that all along we
thought you were your brother, dressed up as a girl.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; said the Babe, &ldquo;so that&rsquo;s the
explanation, is it?&nbsp; If I had only known&mdash;&rdquo;&nbsp;
Then the Babe stopped, and wished he hadn&rsquo;t spoken.</p>
<p>Somerville seized him by the shoulders and, with a sudden
jerk, stood him beside his sister under the gas-jet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You little brute!&rdquo; said Somerville.&nbsp;
&ldquo;It was you all along.&rdquo;&nbsp; And the Babe, seeing
the game was up, and glad that the joke had not been entirely on
one side, confessed.</p>
<p>Jack Herring and Somerville the Briefless went that night with
Johnny and his sister to the theatre&mdash;and on other
nights.&nbsp; Miss Bulstrode thought Jack Herring very nice, and
told her brother so.&nbsp; But she thought Somerville the
Briefless even nicer, and later, under cross-examination, when
Somerville was no longer briefless, told Somerville so
himself.</p>
<p>But that has nothing to do with this particular story, the end
of which is that Miss Bulstrode kept the appointment made for
Monday afternoon between &ldquo;Miss Montgomery&rdquo; and Mr.
Jowett, and secured thereby the Marble Soap advertisement for the
back page of <i>Good Humour</i> for six months, at twenty-five
pounds a week.</p>
<h2>STORY THE SEVENTH&mdash;Dick Danvers presents his
Petition</h2>
<p>William Clodd, mopping his brow, laid down the screwdriver,
and stepping back, regarded the result of his labours with
evident satisfaction.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It looks like a bookcase,&rdquo; said William
Clodd.&nbsp; &ldquo;You might sit in the room for half an hour
and never know it wasn&rsquo;t a bookcase.&rdquo;</p>
<p>What William Clodd had accomplished was this: he had had
prepared, after his own design, what appeared to be four shelves
laden with works suggestive of thought and erudition.&nbsp; As a
matter of fact, it was not a bookcase, but merely a flat board,
the books merely the backs of volumes that had long since found
their way into the paper-mill.&nbsp; This artful deception
William Clodd had screwed upon a cottage piano standing in the
corner of the editorial office of <i>Good Humour</i>.&nbsp; Half
a dozen real volumes piled upon the top of the piano completed
the illusion.&nbsp; As William Clodd had proudly remarked, a
casual visitor might easily have been deceived.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you had to sit in the room while she was practising
mixed scales, you&rsquo;d be quickly undeceived,&rdquo; said the
editor of <i>Good Humour</i>, one Peter Hope.&nbsp; He spoke
bitterly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are not always in,&rdquo; explained Clodd.&nbsp;
&ldquo;There must be hours when she is here alone, with nothing
else to do.&nbsp; Besides, you will get used to it after a
while.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You, I notice, don&rsquo;t try to get used to
it,&rdquo; snarled Peter Hope.&nbsp; &ldquo;You always go out the
moment she commences.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A friend of mine,&rdquo; continued William Clodd,
&ldquo;worked in an office over a piano-shop for seven years, and
when the shop closed, it nearly ruined his business;
couldn&rsquo;t settle down to work for want of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why doesn&rsquo;t he come here?&rdquo; asked Peter
Hope.&nbsp; &ldquo;The floor above is vacant.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t,&rdquo; explained William Clodd.&nbsp;
&ldquo;He&rsquo;s dead.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can quite believe it,&rdquo; commented Peter
Hope.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was a shop where people came and practised, paying
sixpence an hour, and he had got to like it&mdash;said it made a
cheerful background to his thoughts.&nbsp; Wonderful what you can
get accustomed to.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the good of it?&rdquo; demanded Peter
Hope.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the good of it!&rdquo; retorted William
Clodd indignantly.&nbsp; &ldquo;Every girl ought to know how to
play the piano.&nbsp; A nice thing if when her lover asks her to
play something to him&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wonder you don&rsquo;t start a matrimonial
agency,&rdquo; sneered Peter Hope.&nbsp; &ldquo;Love and
marriage&mdash;you think of nothing else.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When you are bringing up a young girl&mdash;&rdquo;
argued Clodd.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you&rsquo;re not,&rdquo; interrupted Peter;
&ldquo;that&rsquo;s just what I&rsquo;m trying to get out of your
head.&nbsp; It is I who am bringing her up.&nbsp; And between
ourselves, I wish you wouldn&rsquo;t interfere so
much.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are not fit to bring up a girl.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve brought her up for seven years without your
help.&nbsp; She&rsquo;s my adopted daughter, not yours.&nbsp; I
do wish people would learn to mind their own business.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve done very well&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; said Peter Hope sarcastically.&nbsp;
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s very kind of you.&nbsp; Perhaps when
you&rsquo;ve time, you&rsquo;ll write me out a
testimonial.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&mdash;up till now,&rdquo; concluded the imperturbable
Clodd.&nbsp; &ldquo;A girl of eighteen wants to know something
else besides mathematics and the classics.&nbsp; You don&rsquo;t
understand them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do understand them,&rdquo; asserted Peter Hope.&nbsp;
&ldquo;What do you know about them?&nbsp; You&rsquo;re not a
father.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve done your best,&rdquo; admitted William
Clodd in a tone of patronage that irritated Peter greatly;
&ldquo;but you&rsquo;re a dreamer; you don&rsquo;t know the
world.&nbsp; The time is coming when the girl will have to think
of a husband.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no need for her to think of a husband,
not for years,&rdquo; retorted Peter Hope.&nbsp; &ldquo;And even
when she does, is strumming on the piano going to help
her?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I tink&mdash;I tink,&rdquo; said Dr. Smith, who had
hitherto remained a silent listener, &ldquo;our young frent Clodd
is right.&nbsp; You haf never quite got over your idea dat she
was going to be a boy.&nbsp; You haf taught her de tings a boy
should know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You cut her hair,&rdquo; added Clodd.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; snapped Peter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You let her have it cut&mdash;it&rsquo;s the same
thing.&nbsp; At eighteen she knows more about the ancient Greeks
and Romans than she does about her own frocks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;De young girl,&rdquo; argued the doctor, &ldquo;what is
she?&nbsp; De flower dat makes bright for us de garden of life,
de gurgling brook dat murmurs by de dusty highway, de cheerful
fire&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She can&rsquo;t be all of them,&rdquo; snapped Peter,
who was a stickler for style.&nbsp; &ldquo;Do keep to one simile
at a time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now you listen to plain sense,&rdquo; said William
Clodd.&nbsp; &ldquo;You want&mdash;we all want&mdash;the girl to
be a success all round.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want her&mdash;&rdquo;&nbsp; Peter Hope was rummaging
among the litter on the desk.&nbsp; It certainly was not
there.&nbsp; Peter pulled out a drawer-two drawers.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I wish,&rdquo; said Peter Hope, &ldquo;I wish sometimes
she wasn&rsquo;t quite so clever.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The old doctor rummaged among dusty files of papers in a
corner.&nbsp; Clodd found it on the mantelpiece concealed beneath
the hollow foot of a big brass candlestick, and handed it to
Peter.</p>
<p>Peter had one vice&mdash;the taking in increasing quantities
of snuff, which was harmful for him, as he himself
admitted.&nbsp; Tommy, sympathetic to most masculine frailties,
was severe, however, upon this one.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You spill it upon your shirt and on your coat,&rdquo;
had argued Tommy.&nbsp; &ldquo;I like to see you always
neat.&nbsp; Besides, it isn&rsquo;t a nice habit.&nbsp; I do
wish, dad, you&rsquo;d give it up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I must,&rdquo; Peter had agreed.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll break myself of it.&nbsp; But not all at
once&mdash;it would be a wrench; by degrees, Tommy, by
degrees.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So a compromise had been compounded.&nbsp; Tommy was to hide
the snuff-box.&nbsp; It was to be somewhere in the room and to be
accessible, but that was all.&nbsp; Peter, when self-control had
reached the breaking-point, might try and find it.&nbsp;
Occasionally, luck helping Peter, he would find it early in the
day, when he would earn his own bitter self-reproaches by
indulging in quite an orgie.&nbsp; But more often Tommy&rsquo;s
artfulness was such that he would be compelled, by want of time,
to abandon the search.&nbsp; Tommy always knew when he had failed
by the air of indignant resignation with which he would greet her
on her return.&nbsp; Then perhaps towards evening, Peter, looking
up, would see the box open before his nose, above it, a pair of
reproving black eyes, their severity counterbalanced by a pair of
full red lips trying not to smile.&nbsp; And Peter, knowing that
only one pinch would be permitted, would dip deeply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want her,&rdquo; said Peter Hope, feeling with his
snuff-box in his hand more confidence in his own judgment,
&ldquo;to be a sensible, clever woman, capable of earning her own
living and of being independent; not a mere helpless doll, crying
for some man to come and take care of her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A woman&rsquo;s business,&rdquo; asserted Clodd,
&ldquo;is to be taken care of.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some women, perhaps,&rdquo; admitted Peter; &ldquo;but
Tommy, you know very well, is not going to be the ordinary type
of woman.&nbsp; She has brains; she will make her way in the
world.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t depend upon brains,&rdquo; said
Clodd.&nbsp; &ldquo;She hasn&rsquo;t got the elbows.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The elbows?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They are not sharp enough.&nbsp; The last &rsquo;bus
home on a wet night tells you whether a woman is capable of
pushing her own way in the world.&nbsp; Tommy&rsquo;s the sort to
get left on the kerb.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s the sort,&rdquo; retorted Peter, &ldquo;to
make a name for herself and to be able to afford a cab.&nbsp;
Don&rsquo;t you bully me!&rdquo;&nbsp; Peter sniffed
self-assertiveness from between his thumb and finger.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I shall,&rdquo; Clodd told him, &ldquo;on this
particular point.&nbsp; The poor girl&rsquo;s got no
mother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Fortunately for the general harmony the door opened at the
moment to admit the subject of discussion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Got that <i>Daisy Blossom</i> advertisement out of old
Blatchley,&rdquo; announced Tommy, waving triumphantly a piece of
paper over her head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo; exclaimed Peter.&nbsp; &ldquo;How did you
manage it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Asked him for it,&rdquo; was Tommy&rsquo;s
explanation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very odd,&rdquo; mused Peter; &ldquo;asked the old
idiot for it myself only last week.&nbsp; He refused it
point-blank.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Clodd snorted reproof.&nbsp; &ldquo;You know I don&rsquo;t
like your doing that sort of thing.&nbsp; It isn&rsquo;t proper
for a young girl&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all right,&rdquo; assured him Tommy;
&ldquo;he&rsquo;s bald!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That makes no difference,&rdquo; was Clodd&rsquo;s
opinion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes it does,&rdquo; was Tommy&rsquo;s.&nbsp; &ldquo;I
like them bald.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tommy took Peter&rsquo;s head between her hands and kissed it,
and in doing so noticed the tell-tale specks of snuff.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just a pinch, my dear,&rdquo; explained Peter,
&ldquo;the merest pinch.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tommy took up the snuff-box from the desk.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll show you where I&rsquo;m going to put it this
time.&rdquo;&nbsp; She put it in her pocket.&nbsp; Peter&rsquo;s
face fell.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you think of it?&rdquo; said Clodd.&nbsp; He
led her to the corner.&nbsp; &ldquo;Good idea, ain&rsquo;t
it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, where&rsquo;s the piano?&rdquo; demanded
Tommy.</p>
<p>Clodd turned in delighted triumph to the others.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Humbug!&rdquo; growled Peter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t humbug,&rdquo; cried Clodd
indignantly.&nbsp; &ldquo;She thought it was a
bookcase&mdash;anybody would.&nbsp; You&rsquo;ll be able to sit
there and practise by the hour,&rdquo; explained Clodd to
Tommy.&nbsp; &ldquo;When you hear anybody coming up the stairs,
you can leave off.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How can she hear anything when she&mdash;&rdquo;&nbsp;
A bright idea occurred to Peter.&nbsp; &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you
think, Clodd, as a practical man,&rdquo; suggested Peter
insinuatingly, adopting the Socratic method, &ldquo;that if we
got her one of those dummy pianos&mdash;you know what I mean;
it&rsquo;s just like an ordinary piano, only you don&rsquo;t hear
it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Clodd shook his head.&nbsp; &ldquo;No good at all.&nbsp;
Can&rsquo;t tell the effect she is producing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quite so.&nbsp; Then, on the other hand, Clodd,
don&rsquo;t you think that hearing the effect they are producing
may sometimes discourage the beginner?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Clodd&rsquo;s opinion was that such discouragement was a thing
to be battled with.</p>
<p>Tommy, who had seated herself, commenced a scale in contrary
motion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m going across to the printer&rsquo;s
now,&rdquo; explained Clodd, taking up his hat.&nbsp; &ldquo;Got
an appointment with young Grindley at three.&nbsp; You stick to
it.&nbsp; A spare half-hour now and then that you never miss does
wonders.&nbsp; You&rsquo;ve got it in you.&rdquo;&nbsp; With
these encouraging remarks to Tommy, Clodd disappeared.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Easy for him,&rdquo; muttered Peter bitterly.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Always does have an appointment outside the moment she
begins.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tommy appeared to be throwing her very soul into the
performance.&nbsp; Passers-by in Crane Court paused, regarded the
first-floor windows of the publishing and editorial offices of
<i>Good Humour</i> with troubled looks, then hurried on.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She has&mdash;remarkably firm douch!&rdquo; shouted the
doctor into Peter&rsquo;s ear.&nbsp; &ldquo;Will see
you&mdash;evening.&nbsp; Someting&mdash;say to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The fat little doctor took his hat and departed.&nbsp; Tommy,
ceasing suddenly, came over and seated herself on the arm of
Peter&rsquo;s chair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Feeling grumpy?&rdquo; asked Tommy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; explained Peter, &ldquo;that I
mind the noise.&nbsp; I&rsquo;d put up with that if I could see
the good of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s going to help me to get a husband,
dad.&nbsp; Seems to me an odd way of doing it; but Billy says so,
and Billy knows all about everything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t understand you, a sensible girl,
listening to such nonsense,&rdquo; said Peter.&nbsp;
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s that that troubles me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dad, where are your wits?&rdquo; demanded Tommy.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t Billy acting like a brick?&nbsp; Why, he could
go into Fleet Street to half a dozen other papers and make five
hundred a year as advertising-agent&mdash;you know he
could.&nbsp; But he doesn&rsquo;t.&nbsp; He sticks to us.&nbsp;
If my making myself ridiculous with that tin pot they persuaded
him was a piano is going to please him, isn&rsquo;t it common
sense and sound business, to say nothing of good nature and
gratitude, for me to do it?&nbsp; Dad, I&rsquo;ve got a surprise
for him.&nbsp; Listen.&rdquo;&nbsp; And Tommy, springing from the
arm of Peter&rsquo;s chair, returned to the piano.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What was it?&rdquo; questioned Tommy, having
finished.&nbsp; &ldquo;Could you recognise it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think,&rdquo; said Peter, &ldquo;it sounded
like&mdash;It wasn&rsquo;t &lsquo;Home, Sweet Home,&rsquo; was
it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tommy clapped her hands.&nbsp; &ldquo;Yes, it was.&nbsp;
You&rsquo;ll end by liking it yourself, dad.&nbsp; We&rsquo;ll
have musical &lsquo;At Homes.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tommy, have I brought you up properly, do you
think?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No dad, you haven&rsquo;t.&nbsp; You have let me have
my own way too much.&nbsp; You know the proverb: &lsquo;Good
mothers make bad daughters.&rsquo;&nbsp; Clodd&rsquo;s right;
you&rsquo;ve spoilt me, dad.&nbsp; Do you remember, dad, when I
first came to you, seven years ago, a ragged little brat out of
the streets, that didn&rsquo;t know itself whether &rsquo;twas a
boy or a girl?&nbsp; Do you know what I thought to myself the
moment I set eyes on you?&nbsp; &lsquo;Here&rsquo;s a soft old
juggins; I&rsquo;ll be all right if I can get in
here!&rsquo;&nbsp; It makes you smart, knocking about in the
gutters and being knocked about; you read faces
quickly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you remember your cooking, Tommy?&nbsp; You
&lsquo;had an aptitude for it,&rsquo; according to your own
idea.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tommy laughed.&nbsp; &ldquo;I wonder how you stood
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You were so obstinate.&nbsp; You came to me as
&lsquo;cook and housekeeper,&rsquo; and as cook and housekeeper,
and as nothing else, would you remain.&nbsp; If I suggested any
change, up would go your chin into the air.&nbsp; I dared not
even dine out too often, you were such a little tyrant.&nbsp; The
only thing you were always ready to do, if I wasn&rsquo;t
satisfied, was to march out of the house and leave me.&nbsp;
Wherever did you get that savage independence of
yours?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know.&nbsp; I think it must have been
from a woman&mdash;perhaps she was my mother; I don&rsquo;t
know&mdash;who used to sit up in the bed and cough, all night it
seemed to me.&nbsp; People would come to see us&mdash;ladies in
fine clothes, and gentlemen with oily hair.&nbsp; I think they
wanted to help us.&nbsp; Many of them had kind voices.&nbsp; But
always a hard look would come into her face, and she would tell
them what even then I knew to be untrue&mdash;it was one of the
first things I can recollect&mdash;that we had everything we
wanted, that we needed no help from anyone.&nbsp; They would go
away, shrugging their shoulders.&nbsp; I grew up with the feeling
that seemed to have been burnt into my brain, that to take from
anybody anything you had not earned was shameful.&nbsp; I
don&rsquo;t think I could do it even now, not even from
you.&nbsp; I am useful to you, dad&mdash;I do help
you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>There had crept a terror into Tommy&rsquo;s voice.&nbsp; Peter
felt the little hands upon his arm trembling.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Help me?&nbsp; Why, you work like a nigger&mdash;like a
nigger is supposed to work, but doesn&rsquo;t.&nbsp; No
one&mdash;whatever we paid him&mdash;would do half as much.&nbsp;
I don&rsquo;t want to make your head more swollen than it is,
young woman, but you have talent; I am not sure it is not
genius.&rdquo;&nbsp; Peter felt the little hands tighten upon his
arm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do want this paper to be a success; that is why I
strum upon the piano to please Clodd.&nbsp; Is it
humbug?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am afraid it is; but humbug is the sweet oil that
helps this whirling world of ours to spin round smoothly.&nbsp;
Too much of it cloys: we drop it very gently.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you are sure it is only humbug, Tommy?&rdquo;&nbsp;
It was Peter&rsquo;s voice into which fear had entered now.&nbsp;
&ldquo;It is not that you think he understands you better than I
do&mdash;would do more for you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You want me to tell you all I think of you, and that
isn&rsquo;t good for you, dad&mdash;not too often.&nbsp; It would
be you who would have swelled head then.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am jealous, Tommy, jealous of everyone that comes
near you.&nbsp; Life is a tragedy for us old folks.&nbsp; We know
there must come a day when you will leave the nest, leave us
voiceless, ridiculous, flitting among bare branches.&nbsp; You
will understand later, when you have children of your own.&nbsp;
This foolish talk about a husband!&nbsp; It is worse for a man
than it is for the woman.&nbsp; The mother lives again in her
child: the man is robbed of all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dad, do you know how old I am?&mdash;that you are
talking terrible nonsense?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He will come, little girl.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; answered Tommy, &ldquo;I suppose he will;
but not for a long while&mdash;oh, not for a very long
while.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t.&nbsp; It frightens me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You?&nbsp; Why should it frighten you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The pain.&nbsp; It makes me feel a coward.&nbsp; I want
it to come; I want to taste life, to drain the whole cup, to
understand, to feel.&nbsp; But that is the boy in me.&nbsp; I am
more than half a boy, I always have been.&nbsp; But the woman in
me: it shrinks from the ordeal.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You talk, Tommy, as if love were something
terrible.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There are all things in it; I feel it, dad.&nbsp; It is
life in a single draught.&nbsp; It frightens me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The child was standing with her face hidden behind her
hands.&nbsp; Old Peter, always very bad at lying, stood silent,
not knowing what consolation to concoct.&nbsp; The shadow passed,
and Tommy&rsquo;s laughing eyes looked out again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t you anything to do, dad&mdash;outside, I
mean?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You want to get rid of me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ve nothing else to occupy me till the
proofs come in.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m going to practise,
hard.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think I&rsquo;ll turn over my article on the
Embankment,&rdquo; said Peter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s one thing you all of you ought to be
grateful to me for,&rdquo; laughed Tommy, as she seated herself
at the piano.&nbsp; &ldquo;I do induce you all to take more fresh
air than otherwise you would.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tommy, left alone, set herself to her task with the energy and
thoroughness that were characteristic of her.&nbsp; Struggling
with complicated scales, Tommy bent her eyes closer and closer
over the pages of <i>Czerny&rsquo;s Exercises</i>.&nbsp; Glancing
up to turn a page, Tommy, to her surprise, met the eyes of a
stranger.&nbsp; They were brown eyes, their expression
sympathetic.&nbsp; Below them, looking golden with the sunlight
falling on it, was a moustache and beard cut short in Vandyke
fashion, not altogether hiding a pleasant mouth, about the
corners of which lurked a smile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I beg your pardon,&rdquo; said the stranger.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I knocked three times.&nbsp; Perhaps you did not hear
me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I didn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; confessed Tommy, closing the
book of <i>Czerny&rsquo;s Exercises</i>, and rising with chin at
an angle that, to anyone acquainted with the chart of
Tommy&rsquo;s temperament, might have suggested the advisability
of seeking shelter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is the editorial office of <i>Good Humour</i>, is
it not?&rdquo; inquired the stranger.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is the editor in?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The editor is out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The sub-editor?&rdquo; suggested the stranger.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am the sub-editor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The stranger raised his eyebrows.&nbsp; Tommy, on the
contrary, lowered hers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Would you mind glancing through that?&rdquo;&nbsp; The
stranger drew from his pocket a folded manuscript.&nbsp;
&ldquo;It will not take you a moment.&nbsp; I ought, of course,
to have sent it through the post; but I am so tired of sending
things through the post.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The stranger&rsquo;s manner was compounded of dignified
impudence combined with pathetic humility.&nbsp; His eyes both
challenged and pleaded.&nbsp; Tommy held out her hand for the
paper and retired with it behind the protection of the big
editorial desk that, flanked on one side by a screen and on the
other by a formidable revolving bookcase, stretched fortress-like
across the narrow room.&nbsp; The stranger remained standing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s pretty,&rdquo; criticised the
sub-editor.&nbsp; &ldquo;Worth printing, perhaps, not worth
paying for.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not merely a&mdash;a nominal sum, sufficient to
distinguish it from the work of the amateur?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tommy pursed her lips.&nbsp; &ldquo;Poetry is quite a drug in
the market.&nbsp; We can get as much as we want of it for
nothing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say half a crown,&rdquo; suggested the stranger.</p>
<p>Tommy shot a swift glance across the desk, and for the first
time saw the whole of him.&nbsp; He was clad in a threadbare,
long, brown ulster&mdash;long, that is, it would have been upon
an ordinary man, but the stranger happening to be remarkably
tall, it appeared on him ridiculously short, reaching only to his
knees.&nbsp; Round his neck and tucked into his waistcoat, thus
completely hiding the shirt and collar he may have been wearing
or may not, was carefully arranged a blue silk muffler.&nbsp; His
hands, which were bare, looked blue and cold.&nbsp; Yet the black
frock-coat and waistcoat and French grey trousers bore the
unmistakable cut of a first-class tailor and fitted him to
perfection.&nbsp; His hat, which he had rested on the desk, shone
resplendent, and the handle of his silk umbrella was an
eagle&rsquo;s head in gold, with two small rubies for the
eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can leave it if you like,&rdquo; consented
Tommy.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll speak to the editor about it when
he returns.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You won&rsquo;t forget it?&rdquo; urged the
stranger.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; answered Tommy.&nbsp; &ldquo;I shall not
forget it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her black eyes were fixed upon the stranger without her being
aware of it.&nbsp; She had dropped unconsciously into her
&ldquo;stocktaking&rdquo; attitude.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you very much,&rdquo; said the stranger.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I will call again to-morrow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The stranger, moving backward to the door, went out.</p>
<p>Tommy sat with her face between her hands.&nbsp;
<i>Czerny&rsquo;s Exercises</i> lay neglected.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Anybody called?&rdquo; asked Peter Hope.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; answered Tommy.&nbsp; &ldquo;Oh, just a
man.&nbsp; Left this&mdash;not bad.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The old story,&rdquo; mused Peter, as he unfolded the
manuscript.&nbsp; &ldquo;We all of us begin with poetry.&nbsp;
Then we take to prose romances; poetry doesn&rsquo;t pay.&nbsp;
Finally, we write articles: &lsquo;How to be Happy though
Married,&rsquo; &lsquo;What shall we do with our
Daughters?&rsquo;&nbsp; It is life summarised.&nbsp; What is it
all about?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, the usual sort of thing,&rdquo; explained
Tommy.&nbsp; &ldquo;He wants half a crown for it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Poor devil!&nbsp; Let him have it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s not business,&rdquo; growled Tommy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nobody will ever know,&rdquo; said Peter.&nbsp;
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll enter it as
&lsquo;telegrams.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The stranger called early the next day, pocketed his
half-crown, and left another manuscript&mdash;an essay.&nbsp;
Also he left behind him his gold-handled umbrella, taking away
with him instead an old alpaca thing Clodd kept in reserve for
exceptionally dirty weather.&nbsp; Peter pronounced the essay
usable.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He has a style,&rdquo; said Peter; &ldquo;he writes
with distinction.&nbsp; Make an appointment for me with
him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Clodd, on missing his umbrella, was indignant.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the good of this thing to me?&rdquo;
commented Clodd.&nbsp; &ldquo;Sort of thing for a dude in a
pantomime!&nbsp; The fellow must be a blithering ass!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tommy gave to the stranger messages from both when next he
called.&nbsp; He appeared more grieved than surprised concerning
the umbrellas.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t think Mr. Clodd would like to keep this
umbrella in exchange for his own?&rdquo; he suggested.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hardly his style,&rdquo; explained Tommy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s very peculiar,&rdquo; said the stranger,
with a smile.&nbsp; &ldquo;I have been trying to get rid of this
umbrella for the last three weeks.&nbsp; Once upon a time, when I
preferred to keep my own umbrella, people used to take it by
mistake, leaving all kinds of shabby things behind them in
exchange.&nbsp; Now, when I&rsquo;d really like to get quit of
it, nobody will have it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why do you want to get rid of it?&rdquo; asked
Tommy.&nbsp; &ldquo;It looks a very good umbrella.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t know how it hampers me,&rdquo; said the
stranger.&nbsp; &ldquo;I have to live up to it.&nbsp; It requires
a certain amount of resolution to enter a cheap restaurant
accompanied by that umbrella.&nbsp; When I do, the waiters draw
my attention to the most expensive dishes and recommend me
special brands of their so-called champagne.&nbsp; They seem
quite surprised if I only want a chop and a glass of beer.&nbsp;
I haven&rsquo;t always got the courage to disappoint them.&nbsp;
It is really becoming quite a curse to me.&nbsp; If I use it to
stop a &rsquo;bus, three or four hansoms dash up and quarrel over
me.&nbsp; I can&rsquo;t do anything I want to do.&nbsp; I want to
live simply and inexpensively: it will not let me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tommy laughed.&nbsp; &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t you lose
it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The stranger laughed also.&nbsp; &ldquo;Lose it!&nbsp; You
have no idea how honest people are.&nbsp; I hadn&rsquo;t
myself.&nbsp; The whole world has gone up in my estimation within
the last few weeks.&nbsp; People run after me for quite long
distances and force it into my hand&mdash;people on rainy days
who haven&rsquo;t got umbrellas of their own.&nbsp; It is the
same with this hat.&rdquo;&nbsp; The stranger sighed as he took
it up.&nbsp; &ldquo;I am always trying to get <i>off</i> with
something reasonably shabby in exchange for it.&nbsp; I am always
found out and stopped.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you pawn them?&rdquo; suggested the
practicable Tommy.</p>
<p>The stranger regarded her with admiration.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you know, I never thought of that,&rdquo; said the
stranger.&nbsp; &ldquo;Of course.&nbsp; What a good idea!&nbsp;
Thank you so much.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The stranger departed, evidently much relieved.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Silly fellow,&rdquo; mused Tommy.&nbsp; &ldquo;They
won&rsquo;t give him a quarter of the value, and he will say:
&lsquo;Thank you so much,&rsquo; and be quite
contented.&rdquo;&nbsp; It worried Tommy a good deal that day,
the thought of that stranger&rsquo;s helplessness.</p>
<p>The stranger&rsquo;s name was Richard Danvers.&nbsp; He lived
the other side of Holborn, in Featherstone Buildings, but much of
his time came to be spent in the offices of <i>Good
Humour</i>.</p>
<p>Peter liked him.&nbsp; &ldquo;Full of promise,&rdquo; was
Peter&rsquo;s opinion.&nbsp; &ldquo;His criticism of that article
of mine on &lsquo;The Education of Woman&rsquo; showed both sense
and feeling.&nbsp; A scholar and a thinker.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Flipp, the office-boy (spelt Philip), liked him; and
Flipp&rsquo;s attitude, in general, was censorial.&nbsp;
&ldquo;He&rsquo;s all right,&rdquo; pronounced Flipp;
&ldquo;nothing stuck-up about him.&nbsp; He&rsquo;s got plenty of
sense, lying hidden away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Miss Ramsbotham liked him.&nbsp; &ldquo;The men&mdash;the men
we think about at all,&rdquo; explained Miss
Ramsbotham&mdash;&ldquo;may be divided into two classes: the men
we ought to like, but don&rsquo;t; and the men there is no
particular reason for our liking, but that we do.&nbsp;
Personally I could get very fond of your friend Dick.&nbsp; There
is nothing whatever attractive about him except
himself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Even Tommy liked him in her way, though at times she was
severe with him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you mean a big street,&rdquo; grumbled Tommy, who
was going over proofs, &ldquo;why not say a big street?&nbsp; Why
must you always call it a &lsquo;main artery&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am sorry,&rdquo; apologised Danvers.&nbsp; &ldquo;It
is not my own idea.&nbsp; You told me to study the higher-class
journals.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t tell you to select and follow all their
faults.&nbsp; Here it is again.&nbsp; Your crowd is always a
&lsquo;hydra-headed monster&rsquo;; your tea &lsquo;the cup that
cheers but not inebriates.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am afraid I am a deal of trouble to you,&rdquo;
suggested the staff.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am afraid you are,&rdquo; agreed the sub-editor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t give me up,&rdquo; pleaded the staff.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I misunderstood you, that is all.&nbsp; I will write
English for the future.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shall be glad if you will,&rdquo; growled the
sub-editor.</p>
<p>Dick Danvers rose.&nbsp; &ldquo;I am so anxious not to get
what you call &lsquo;the sack&rsquo; from here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The sub-editor, mollified, thought the staff need be under no
apprehension, provided it showed itself teachable.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have been rather a worthless fellow, Miss
Hope,&rdquo; confessed Dick Danvers.&nbsp; &ldquo;I was beginning
to despair of myself till I came across you and your
father.&nbsp; The atmosphere here&mdash;I don&rsquo;t mean the
material atmosphere of Crane Court&mdash;is so invigorating: its
simplicity, its sincerity.&nbsp; I used to have ideals.&nbsp; I
tried to stifle them.&nbsp; There is a set that sneers at all
that sort of thing.&nbsp; Now I see that they are good.&nbsp; You
will help me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Every woman is a mother.&nbsp; Tommy felt for the moment that
she wanted to take this big boy on her knee and talk to him for
his good.&nbsp; He was only an overgrown lad.&nbsp; But so
exceedingly overgrown!&nbsp; Tommy had to content herself with
holding out her hand.&nbsp; Dick Danvers grasped it tightly.</p>
<p>Clodd was the only one who did not approve of him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How did you get hold of him?&rdquo; asked Clodd one
afternoon, he and Peter alone in the office.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He came.&nbsp; He came in the usual way,&rdquo;
explained Peter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you know about him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing.&nbsp; What is there to know?&nbsp; One
doesn&rsquo;t ask for a character with a journalist.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I suppose that wouldn&rsquo;t work.&nbsp; Found out
anything about him since?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing against him.&nbsp; Why so suspicious of
everybody?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because you are just a woolly lamb and want a dog to
look after you.&nbsp; Who is he?&nbsp; On a first night he gives
away his stall and sneaks into the pit.&nbsp; When you send him
to a picture-gallery, he dodges the private view and goes on the
first shilling day.&nbsp; If an invitation comes to a public
dinner, he asks me to go and eat it for him and tell him what
it&rsquo;s all about.&nbsp; That doesn&rsquo;t suggest the frank
and honest journalist, does it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is unusual, it certainly is unusual,&rdquo; Peter
was bound to admit.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I distrust the man,&rdquo; said Clodd.&nbsp;
&ldquo;He&rsquo;s not our class.&nbsp; What is he doing
here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will ask him, Clodd; I will ask him straight
out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And believe whatever he tells you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I shan&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then what&rsquo;s the good of asking him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, what am I to do?&rdquo; demanded the bewildered
Peter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Get rid of him,&rdquo; suggested Clodd.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Get rid of him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Get him away!&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t have him in and out of
the office all day long-looking at her with those collie-dog eyes
of his, arguing art and poetry with her in that cushat-dove voice
of his.&nbsp; Get him clean away&mdash;if it isn&rsquo;t too late
already.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nonsense,&rdquo; said Peter, who had turned white,
however.&nbsp; &ldquo;She&rsquo;s not that sort of
girl.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not that sort of girl!&rdquo;&nbsp; Clodd had no
patience with Peter Hope, and told him so.&nbsp; &ldquo;Why are
there never inkstains on her fingers now?&nbsp; There used to
be.&nbsp; Why does she always keep a lemon in her drawer?&nbsp;
When did she last have her hair cut?&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll tell you if
you care to know&mdash;the week before he came, five months
ago.&nbsp; She used to have it cut once a fortnight: said it
tickled her neck.&nbsp; Why does she jump on people when they
call her Tommy and tell them that her name is Jane?&nbsp; It
never used to be Jane.&nbsp; Maybe when you&rsquo;re a bit older
you&rsquo;ll begin to notice things for yourself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Clodd jammed his hat on his head and flung himself down the
stairs.</p>
<p>Peter, slipping out a minute later, bought himself an ounce of
snuff.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fiddle-de-dee!&rdquo; said Peter as he helped himself
to his thirteenth pinch.&nbsp; &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t believe
it.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll sound her.&nbsp; I shan&rsquo;t say a
word&mdash;I&rsquo;ll just sound her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Peter stood with his back to the fire.&nbsp; Tommy sat at her
desk, correcting proofs of a fanciful story: <i>The Man Without a
Past</i>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall miss him,&rdquo; said Peter; &ldquo;I know I
shall.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Miss whom?&rdquo; demanded Tommy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Danvers,&rdquo; sighed Peter.&nbsp; &ldquo;It always
happens so.&nbsp; You get friendly with a man; then he goes
away&mdash;abroad, back to America, Lord knows where.&nbsp; You
never see him again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tommy looked up.&nbsp; There was trouble in her face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do you spell &lsquo;harassed&rsquo;?&rdquo;
questioned Tommy! &ldquo;two r&rsquo;s or one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;One r,&rdquo; Peter informed her, &ldquo;two
s&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought so.&rdquo;&nbsp; The trouble passed from
Tommy&rsquo;s face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t ask when he&rsquo;s going, you
don&rsquo;t ask where he&rsquo;s going,&rdquo; complained
Peter.&nbsp; &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t seem to be interested in the
least.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was going to ask, so soon as I had finished
correcting this sheet,&rdquo; explained Tommy.&nbsp; &ldquo;What
reason does he give?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Peter had crossed over and was standing where he could see her
face illumined by the lamplight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t upset you&mdash;the thought of his
going away, of your never seeing him again?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why should it?&rdquo;&nbsp; Tommy answered his
searching gaze with a slightly puzzled look.&nbsp; &ldquo;Of
course, I&rsquo;m sorry.&nbsp; He was becoming useful.&nbsp; But
we couldn&rsquo;t expect him to stop with us always, could
we?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Peter, rubbing his hands, broke into a chuckle.&nbsp; &ldquo;I
told him &rsquo;twas all fiddlesticks.&nbsp; Clodd, he would have
it you were growing to care for the fellow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For Dick Danvers?&rdquo; Tommy laughed.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Whatever put that into his head?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, well, there were one or two little things that we
had noticed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I mean that Clodd had noticed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m glad it was Clodd that noticed them, not you, dad,
thought Tommy to herself.&nbsp; They&rsquo;d have been pretty
obvious if you had noticed them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It naturally made me anxious,&rdquo; confessed
Peter.&nbsp; &ldquo;You see, we know absolutely nothing of the
fellow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Absolutely nothing,&rdquo; agreed Tommy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He may be a man of the highest integrity.&nbsp;
Personally, I think he is.&nbsp; I like him.&nbsp; On the other
hand, he may be a thorough-paced scoundrel.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t
believe for a moment that he is, but he may be.&nbsp; Impossible
to say.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quite impossible,&rdquo; agreed Tommy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Considered merely as a journalist, it doesn&rsquo;t
matter.&nbsp; He writes well.&nbsp; He has brains.&nbsp;
There&rsquo;s an end of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is very painstaking,&rdquo; agreed Tommy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Personally,&rdquo; added Peter, &ldquo;I like the
fellow.&rdquo;&nbsp; Tommy had returned to her work.</p>
<p>Of what use was Peter in a crisis of this kind?&nbsp; Peter
couldn&rsquo;t scold.&nbsp; Peter couldn&rsquo;t bully.&nbsp; The
only person to talk to Tommy as Tommy knew she needed to be
talked to was one Jane, a young woman of dignity with sense of
the proprieties.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do hope that at least you are feeling ashamed of
yourself,&rdquo; remarked Jane to Tommy that same night, as the
twain sat together in their little bedroom.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Done nothing to be ashamed of,&rdquo; growled
Tommy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Making a fool of yourself openly, for everybody to
notice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Clodd ain&rsquo;t everybody.&nbsp; He&rsquo;s got eyes
at the back of his head.&nbsp; Sees things before they
happen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s your woman&rsquo;s pride: falling in love
with a man who has never spoken to you, except in terms of the
most ordinary courtesy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not in love with him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A man about whom you know absolutely
nothing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not in love with him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where does he come from?&nbsp; Who is he?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, don&rsquo;t care; nothing to do
with me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just because of his soft eyes, and his wheedling voice,
and that half-caressing, half-devotional manner of his.&nbsp; Do
you imagine he keeps it specially for you?&nbsp; I gave you
credit for more sense.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not in love with him, I tell you.&nbsp;
He&rsquo;s down on his luck, and I&rsquo;m sorry for him,
that&rsquo;s all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And if he is, whose fault was it, do you
think?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t matter.&nbsp; We are none of us
saints.&nbsp; He&rsquo;s trying to pull himself together, and I
respect him for it.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s our duty to be charitable
and kind to one another in this world!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, well, I&rsquo;ll tell you how you can be kind to
him: by pointing out to him that he is wasting his time.&nbsp;
With his talents, now that he knows his business, he could be on
the staff of some big paper, earning a good income.&nbsp; Put it
nicely to him, but be firm.&nbsp; Insist on his going.&nbsp; That
will be showing true kindness to him&mdash;and to yourself, too,
I&rsquo;m thinking, my dear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And Tommy understood and appreciated the sound good sense
underlying Jane&rsquo;s advice, and the very next day but one,
seizing the first opportunity, acted upon it; and all would have
gone as contemplated if only Dick Danvers had sat still and
listened, as it had been arranged in Tommy&rsquo;s programme that
he should.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I don&rsquo;t want to go,&rdquo; said Dick.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you ought to want to go.&nbsp; Staying here with us
you are doing yourself no good.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He rose and came to where she stood with one foot upon the
fender, looking down into the fire.&nbsp; His doing this
disconcerted her.&nbsp; So long as he remained seated at the
other end of the room, she was the sub-editor, counselling the
staff for its own good.&nbsp; Now that she could not raise her
eyes without encountering his, she felt painfully conscious of
being nothing more important than a little woman who was
trembling.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is doing me all the good in the world,&rdquo; he
told her, &ldquo;being near to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, please do sit down again,&rdquo; she urged
him.&nbsp; &ldquo;I can talk to you so much better when
you&rsquo;re sitting down.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But he would not do anything he should have done that
day.&nbsp; Instead he took her hands in his, and would not let
them go; and the reason and the will went out of her, leaving her
helpless.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let me be with you always,&rdquo; he pleaded.&nbsp;
&ldquo;It means the difference between light and darkness to
me.&nbsp; You have done so much for me.&nbsp; Will you not finish
your work?&nbsp; Will you not trust me?&nbsp; It is no hot
passion that can pass away, my love for you.&nbsp; It springs
from all that is best in me&mdash;from the part of me that is
wholesome and joyous and strong, the part of me that belongs to
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Releasing her, he turned away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The other part of me&mdash;the blackguard&mdash;it is
dead, dear,&mdash;dead and buried.&nbsp; I did not know I was a
blackguard, I thought myself a fine fellow, till one day it came
home to me.&nbsp; Suddenly I saw myself as I really was.&nbsp;
And the sight of the thing frightened me and I ran away from
it.&nbsp; I said to myself I would begin life afresh, in a new
country, free of every tie that could bind me to the past.&nbsp;
It would mean poverty&mdash;privation, maybe, in the
beginning.&nbsp; What of that?&nbsp; The struggle would brace
me.&nbsp; It would be good sport.&nbsp; Ah, well, you can guess
the result: the awakening to the cold facts, the reaction of
feeling.&nbsp; In what way was I worse than other men?&nbsp; Who
was I, to play the prig in a world where others were laughing and
dining?&nbsp; I had tramped your city till my boots were worn
into holes.&nbsp; I had but to abandon my quixotic
ideals&mdash;return to where shame lay waiting for me, to be
welcomed with the fatted calf.&nbsp; It would have ended so had I
not chanced to pass by your door that afternoon and hear you
strumming on the piano.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So Billy was right, after all, thought Tommy to herself, the
piano does help.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was so incongruous&mdash;a piano in Crane
Court&mdash;I looked to see where the noise came from.&nbsp; I
read the name of the paper on the doorpost.&nbsp; &lsquo;It will
be my last chance,&rsquo; I said to myself.&nbsp; &lsquo;This
shall decide it.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>He came back to her.&nbsp; She had not moved.&nbsp; &ldquo;I
am not afraid to tell you all this.&nbsp; You are so big-hearted,
so human; you will understand, you can forgive.&nbsp; It is all
past.&nbsp; Loving you tells a man that he has done with
evil.&nbsp; Will you not trust me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She put her hands in his.&nbsp; &ldquo;I am trusting
you,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;with all my life.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t
make a muddle of it, dear, if you can help it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was an odd wooing, as Tommy laughingly told herself when
she came to think it over in her room that night.&nbsp; But that
is how it shaped itself.</p>
<p>What troubled her most was that he had not been quite frank
with Peter, so that Peter had to defend her against herself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I attacked you so suddenly,&rdquo; explained Peter,
&ldquo;you had not time to think.&nbsp; You acted from
instinct.&nbsp; A woman seeks to hide her love even from
herself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I expect, after all, I am more of a girl than a
boy,&rdquo; feared Tommy: &ldquo;I seem to have so many womanish
failings.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Peter took himself into quite places and trained himself to
face the fact that another would be more to her than he had ever
been, and Clodd went about his work like a bear with a sore head;
but they neither of them need have troubled themselves so
much.&nbsp; The marriage did not take place till nearly fifteen
years had passed away, and much water had to flow beneath old
London Bridge before that day.</p>
<p>The past is not easily got rid of.&nbsp; A tale was once
written of a woman who killed her babe and buried it in a lonely
wood, and later stole back in the night and saw there, white in
the moonlight, a child&rsquo;s hand calling through the earth,
and buried it again and yet again; but always that white baby
hand called upwards through the earth, trample it down as she
would.&nbsp; Tommy read the story one evening in an old
miscellany, and sat long before the dead fire, the book open on
her lap, and shivered; for now she knew the fear that had been
haunting her.</p>
<p>Tommy lived expecting her.&nbsp; She came one night when Tommy
was alone, working late in the office.&nbsp; Tommy knew her the
moment she entered the door, a handsome woman, with snake-like,
rustling skirts.&nbsp; She closed the door behind her, and
drawing forward a chair, seated herself the other side of the
desk, and the two looked long and anxiously at one another.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They told me I should find you here alone,&rdquo; said
the woman.&nbsp; &ldquo;It is better, is it not?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Tommy, &ldquo;it is better.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell me,&rdquo; said the woman, &ldquo;are you very
much in love with him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why should I tell you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because, if not&mdash;if you have merely accepted him
thinking him a good catch&mdash;which he isn&rsquo;t, my dear;
hasn&rsquo;t a penny to bless himself with, and never will if he
marries you&mdash;why, then the matter is soon settled.&nbsp;
They tell me you are a business-like young lady, and I am
prepared to make a business-like proposition.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was no answer.&nbsp; The woman shrugged her
shoulders.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If, on the other hand, you are that absurd creature, a
young girl in love&mdash;why, then, I suppose we shall have to
fight for him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It would be more sporting, would it not?&rdquo;
suggested Tommy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let me explain before you decide,&rdquo; continued the
woman.&nbsp; &ldquo;Dick Danvers left me six months ago, and has
kept from me ever since, because he loved me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It sounds a curious reason.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was a married woman when Dick Danvers and I first
met.&nbsp; Since he left me&mdash;for my sake and his own&mdash;I
have received information of my husband&rsquo;s death.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And does Dick&mdash;does he know?&rdquo; asked the
girl.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not yet.&nbsp; I have only lately learnt the news
myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then if it is as you say, when he knows he will go back
to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There are difficulties in the way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What difficulties?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear, this.&nbsp; To try and forget me, he has been
making love to you.&nbsp; Men do these things.&nbsp; I merely ask
you to convince yourself of the truth.&nbsp; Go away for six
months&mdash;disappear entirely.&nbsp; Leave him
free&mdash;uninfluenced.&nbsp; If he loves you&mdash;if it be not
merely a sense of honour that binds him&mdash;you will find him
here on your return.&nbsp; If not&mdash;if in the interval I have
succeeded in running off with him, well, is not the two or three
thousand pounds I am prepared to put into this paper of yours a
fair price for such a lover?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tommy rose with a laugh of genuine amusement.&nbsp; She could
never altogether put aside her sense of humour, let Fate come
with what terrifying face it would.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You may have him for nothing&mdash;if he is that
man,&rdquo; the girl told her; &ldquo;he shall be free to choose
between us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mean you will release him from his
engagement?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is what I mean.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why not take my offer?&nbsp; You know the money is
needed.&nbsp; It will save your father years of anxiety and
struggle.&nbsp; Go away&mdash;travel, for a couple of months, if
you&rsquo;re afraid of the six.&nbsp; Write him that you must be
alone, to think things over.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girl turned upon her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And leave you a free field to lie and trick?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The woman, too, had risen.&nbsp; &ldquo;Do you think he really
cares for you?&nbsp; At the moment you interest him.&nbsp; At
nineteen every woman is a mystery.&nbsp; When the mood is
past&mdash;and do you know how long a man&rsquo;s mood lasts, you
poor chit?&nbsp; Till he has caught what he is running after, and
has tasted it&mdash;then he will think not of what he has won,
but of what he has lost: of the society from which he has cut
himself adrift; of all the old pleasures and pursuits he can no
longer enjoy; of the luxuries&mdash;necessities to a man of his
stamp&mdash;that marriage with you has deprived him of.&nbsp;
Then your face will be a perpetual reminder to him of what he has
paid for it, and he will curse it every time he sees
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t know him,&rdquo; the girl cried.&nbsp;
&ldquo;You know just a part of him&mdash;the part you would
know.&nbsp; All the rest of him is a good man, that would rather
his self-respect than all the luxuries you mention&mdash;you
included.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It seems to resolve itself into what manner of man he
is,&rdquo; laughed the woman.</p>
<p>The girl looked at her watch.&nbsp; &ldquo;He will be here
shortly; he shall tell us himself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do you mean?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That here, between the two of us, he shall
decide&mdash;this very night.&rdquo;&nbsp; She showed her white
face to the woman.&nbsp; &ldquo;Do you think I could live through
a second day like to this?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The scene would be ridiculous.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There will be none here to enjoy the humour of
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He will not understand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, he will,&rdquo; the girl laughed.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Come, you have all the advantages; you are rich, you are
clever; you belong to his class.&nbsp; If he elects to stop with
me, it will be because he is my man&mdash;mine.&nbsp; Are you
afraid?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The woman shivered.&nbsp; She wrapped her fur cloak about her
closer and sat down again, and Tommy returned to her
proofs.&nbsp; It was press-night, and there was much to be
done.</p>
<p>He came a little later, though how long the time may have
seemed to the two women one cannot say.&nbsp; They heard his
footstep on the stair.&nbsp; The woman rose and went forward, so
that when he opened the door she was the first he saw.&nbsp; But
he made no sign.&nbsp; Possibly he had been schooling himself for
this moment, knowing that sooner or later it must come.&nbsp; The
woman held out her hand to him with a smile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have not the honour,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>The smile died from her face.&nbsp; &ldquo;I do not
understand,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have not the honour,&rdquo; he repeated.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I do not know you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girl was leaning with her back against the desk in a
somewhat mannish attitude.&nbsp; He stood between them.&nbsp; It
will always remain Life&rsquo;s chief comic success: the man
between two women.&nbsp; The situation has amused the world for
so many years.&nbsp; Yet, somehow, he contrived to maintain a
certain dignity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;you are confounding
me with a Dick Danvers who lived in New York up to a few months
ago.&nbsp; I knew him well&mdash;a worthless scamp you had done
better never to have met.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You bear a wonderful resemblance to him,&rdquo; laughed
the woman.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The poor fool is dead,&rdquo; he answered.&nbsp;
&ldquo;And he left for you, my dear lady, this dying message:
that, from the bottom of his soul, he was sorry for the wrong he
had done you.&nbsp; He asked you to forgive him&mdash;and forget
him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The year appears to be opening unfortunately for
me,&rdquo; said the woman.&nbsp; &ldquo;First my lover, then my
husband.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He had nerved himself to fight the living.&nbsp; This was a
blow from the dead.&nbsp; The man had been his friend.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dead?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He was killed, it appears, in that last expedition in
July,&rdquo; answered the woman.&nbsp; &ldquo;I received the news
from the Foreign Office only a fortnight ago.&rdquo;</p>
<p>An ugly look came into his eyes&mdash;the look of a cornered
creature fighting for its life.&nbsp; &ldquo;Why have you
followed me here?&nbsp; Why do I find you here alone with
her?&nbsp; What have you told her?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The woman shrugged her shoulders.&nbsp; &ldquo;Only the
truth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All the truth?&rdquo; he
demanded&mdash;&ldquo;all?&nbsp; Ah! be just.&nbsp; Tell her it
was not all my fault.&nbsp; Tell her all the truth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What would you have me tell her?&nbsp; That I played
Potiphar&rsquo;s wife to your Joseph?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, no!&nbsp; The truth&mdash;only the truth.&nbsp;
That you and I were a pair of idle fools with the devil dancing
round us.&nbsp; That we played a fool&rsquo;s game, and that it
is over.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is it over?&nbsp; Dick, is it over?&rdquo;&nbsp; She
flung her arms towards him; but he threw her from him almost
brutally.&nbsp; &ldquo;The man is dead, I tell you.&nbsp; His
folly and his sin lie dead with him.&nbsp; I have nothing to do
with you, nor you with me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dick!&rdquo; she whispered.&nbsp; &ldquo;Dick, cannot
you understand?&nbsp; I must speak with you alone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But they did not understand, neither the man nor the
child.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dick, are you really dead?&rdquo; she cried.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Have you no pity for me?&nbsp; Do you think that I have
followed you here to grovel at your feet for mere whim?&nbsp; Am
I acting like a woman sane and sound?&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t you see
that I am mad, and why I am mad?&nbsp; Must I tell you before
her?&nbsp; Dick&mdash;&rdquo;&nbsp; She staggered towards him,
and the fine cloak slipped from her shoulders; and then it was
that Tommy changed from a child into a woman, and raised the
other woman from the ground with crooning words of encouragement
such as mothers use, and led her to the inner room.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Do not go,&rdquo; she said, turning to Dick; &ldquo;I
shall be back in a few minutes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He crossed to one of the windows against which beat the
City&rsquo;s roar, and it seemed to him as the throb of passing
footsteps beating down through the darkness to where he lay in
his grave.</p>
<p>She re-entered, closing the door softly behind her.&nbsp;
&ldquo;It is true?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It can be.&nbsp; I had not thought of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They spoke in low, matter-of-fact tones, as people do who have
grown weary of their own emotions.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When did he go away&mdash;her husband?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;About&mdash;it is February now, is it not?&nbsp; About
eighteen months ago.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And died just eight months ago.&nbsp; Rather
conveniently, poor fellow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I&rsquo;m glad he is dead&mdash;poor
Lawrence.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is the shortest time in which a marriage can be
arranged?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do not know,&rdquo; he answered listlessly.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I do not intend to marry her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You would leave her to bear it alone?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is not as if she were a poor woman.&nbsp; You can do
anything with money.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It will not mend reputation.&nbsp; Her position in
society is everything to that class of woman.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My marrying her now,&rdquo; he pointed out,
&ldquo;would not save her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Practically speaking it would,&rdquo; the girl
pleaded.&nbsp; &ldquo;The world does not go out of its way to
find out things it does not want to know.&nbsp; Marry her as
quietly as possible and travel for a year or two.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why should I?&nbsp; Ah! it is easy enough to call a man
a coward for defending himself against a woman.&nbsp; What is he
to do when he is fighting for his life?&nbsp; Men do not sin with
good women.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is the child to be considered,&rdquo; she
urged&mdash;&ldquo;your child.&nbsp; You see, dear, we all do
wrong sometimes.&nbsp; We must not let others suffer for our
fault more&mdash;more than we can help.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He turned to her for the first time.&nbsp; &ldquo;And
you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I?&nbsp; Oh, I shall cry for a little while, but later
on I shall laugh, as often.&nbsp; Life is not all love.&nbsp; I
have my work.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He knew her well by this time.&nbsp; And also it came to him
that it would be a finer thing to be worthy of her than even to
possess her.</p>
<p>So he did her bidding and went out with the other woman.&nbsp;
Tommy was glad it was press-night.&nbsp; She would not be able to
think for hours to come, and then, perhaps, she would be feeling
too tired.&nbsp; Work can be very kind.</p>
<p>Were this an artistic story, here, of course, one would write
&ldquo;Finis.&rdquo;&nbsp; But in the workaday world one never
knows the ending till it comes.&nbsp; Had it been otherwise, I
doubt I could have found courage to tell you this story of
Tommy.&nbsp; It is not all true&mdash;at least, I do not suppose
so.&nbsp; One drifts unconsciously a little way into dream-land
when one sits oneself down to recall the happenings of long ago;
while Fancy, with a sly wink, whispers ever and again to Memory:
&ldquo;Let me tell this incident&mdash;picture that scene: I can
make it so much more interesting than you would.&rdquo;&nbsp; But
Tommy&mdash;how can I put it without saying too much: there is
someone I think of when I speak of her?&nbsp; To remember only
her dear wounds, and not the healing of them, would have been a
task too painful.&nbsp; I love to dwell on their next
meeting.&nbsp; Flipp, passing him on the steps, did not know him,
the tall, sunburnt gentleman with the sweet, grave-faced little
girl.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Seen that face somewhere before,&rdquo; mused Flipp, as
at the corner of Bedford Street he climbed into a hansom,
&ldquo;seen it somewhere on a thinner man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For Dick Danvers, that he did not recognise Flipp, there was
more excuse.&nbsp; A very old young man had Flipp become at
thirty.&nbsp; Flipp no longer enjoyed popular journalism.&nbsp;
He produced it.</p>
<p>The gold-bound doorkeeper feared the mighty Clodd would be
unable to see so insignificant an atom as an unappointed
stranger, but would let the card of Mr. Richard Danvers plead for
itself.&nbsp; To the gold-bound keeper&rsquo;s surprise came down
the message that Mr. Danvers was to be at once shown up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought, somehow, you would come to me first,&rdquo;
said the portly Clodd, advancing with out-stretched hand.&nbsp;
&ldquo;And this is&mdash;?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My little girl, Honor.&nbsp; We have been travelling
for the last few months.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Clodd took the grave, small face between his big, rough
hands:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&nbsp; She is like you.&nbsp; But looks as if she
were going to have more sense.&nbsp; Forgive me, I knew your
father my dear,&rdquo; laughed Clodd; &ldquo;when he was
younger.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They lit their cigars and talked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, not exactly dead; we amalgamated it,&rdquo;
winked Clodd in answer to Danvers&rsquo; inquiry.&nbsp; &ldquo;It
was just a trifle <i>too</i> high-class.&nbsp; Besides, the old
gentleman was not getting younger.&nbsp; It hurt him a little at
first.&nbsp; But then came Tommy&rsquo;s great success, and that
has reconciled him to all things.&nbsp; Do they know you are in
England?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; explained Danvers; &ldquo;we arrived only
last night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Clodd called directions down the speaking-tube.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You will find hardly any change in her.&nbsp; One still
has to keep one&rsquo;s eye upon her chin.&nbsp; She has not even
lost her old habit of taking stock of people.&nbsp; You
remember.&rdquo;&nbsp; Clodd laughed.</p>
<p>They talked a little longer, till there came a whistle, and
Clodd put his ear to the tube.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have to see her on business,&rdquo; said Clodd,
rising; &ldquo;you may as well come with me.&nbsp; They are still
in the old place, Gough Square.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tommy was out, but Peter was expecting her every minute.</p>
<p>Peter did not know Dick, but would not admit it.&nbsp;
Forgetfulness was a sign of age, and Peter still felt young.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know your face quite well,&rdquo; said Peter;
&ldquo;can&rsquo;t put a name to it, that&rsquo;s all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Clodd whispered it to him, together with information bringing
history up to date.&nbsp; And then light fell upon the old lined
face.&nbsp; He came towards Dick, meaning to take him by both
hands, but, perhaps because he had become somewhat feeble, he
seemed glad when the younger man put his arms around him and held
him for a moment.&nbsp; It was un-English, and both of them felt
a little ashamed of themselves afterwards.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What we want,&rdquo; said Clodd, addressing Peter,
&ldquo;we three&mdash;you, I, and Miss Danvers&mdash;is tea and
cakes, with cream in them; and I know a shop where they sell
them.&nbsp; We will call back for your father in half an
hour.&rdquo;&nbsp; Clodd explained to Miss Danvers; &ldquo;he has
to talk over a matter of business with Miss Hope.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know,&rdquo; answered the grave-faced little
person.&nbsp; She drew Dick&rsquo;s face down to hers and kissed
it.&nbsp; And then the three went out together, leaving Dick
standing by the window.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Couldn&rsquo;t we hide somewhere till she comes?&rdquo;
suggested Miss Danvers.&nbsp; &ldquo;I want to see
her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So they waited in the open doorway of a near printing-house
till Tommy drove up.&nbsp; Both Peter and Clodd watched the
child&rsquo;s face with some anxiety.&nbsp; She nodded gravely to
herself three times, then slipped her hand into
Peter&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>Tommy opened the door with her latchkey and passed in.</p>

Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

copied or distributed:

or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the

     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be

the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,

Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
